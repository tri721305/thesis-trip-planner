# Payment System Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

1. **Duplicate Payment Records**

   - The system was creating new payment records for the same booking instead of updating existing ones
   - This resulted in multiple payment records with different statuses (processing, succeeded) for a single booking

2. **Incomplete Webhook Handling**
   - Webhook handling wasn't properly identifying existing payment records
   - Payment status updates weren't being properly applied

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced `createPayment` Function

- Now checks for existing payments using multiple methods:
  - Search by bookingId reference
  - Search using booking.paymentId reference
- Only updates existing payment if not already in "succeeded" state
- Resets failed payments to "pending" status when retrying

### 2. Enhanced `processPayment` Function

- Now checks for existing successful payments to prevent duplicate processing
- Uses multiple methods to find the relevant payment:
  - Search by paymentIntentId
  - Search by bookingId from Stripe metadata
  - Search using booking's payment reference
- Properly handles cases where payment record is found but needs stripeInfo updated

### 3. Improved Webhook Handler

- Now uses MongoDB transactions for data consistency
- Enhanced payment lookup using multiple methods:
  - Search by paymentIntentId
  - Search by paymentId from metadata
  - Search by bookingId from metadata
- Skip updates if payment is already in the target state
- Added proper logging and error handling
- Better handling of charge disputes

### 4. Metadata Enhancement

- Improved metadata usage in Stripe to ensure proper record linkage
- Includes both paymentId and bookingId in metadata for better record tracking

### 5. Data Consistency Improvements

- Added checks to ensure payment references in bookings are always updated
- Improved validation of payment status before updates
- Proper handling of transaction rollbacks in error scenarios

### 6. Payment Status Recovery Mechanism

We've added functionality to handle "stuck" payments:

- Modified `createStripePaymentIntent` to allow creating payment intents for payments in "processing" state
- Added a dedicated `resetProcessingPayment` function to reset stuck payments back to "pending" state
- Created an API endpoint to securely reset payment status (`/api/payments/reset/{paymentId}`)
- Added a client component (`ResetPaymentButton`) to provide a user interface for this functionality

## Future Recommendations

1. **Add Payment Record Cleanup**

   - Create an admin utility to identify and merge duplicate payment records

2. **Add Additional Validation**

   - Add more comprehensive validation in the payment flow to prevent duplicate records

3. **Implement Better Error Recovery**

   - Add mechanisms to recover from failed payments automatically
   - Implement payment retry logic with backoff

4. **Enhance Monitoring**

   - Implement payment monitoring and alerting for failed payments
   - Add dashboards for payment reconciliation

5. **Improve Payment State Handling**
   - Add automatic cleanup of stuck "processing" payments after a time threshold
   - Implement timeouts and auto-cancellation for payments that stay in processing state too long
