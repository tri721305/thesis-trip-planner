- **Wards with Geometry**: 3,185 (97.97% coverage)
- **Wards without Geometry**: 66
- **Provinces Covered**: 34 (Complete coverage of Vietnam)

### 📊 Import Statistics

- **Files Processed**: 34 JSON files
- **Successfully Imported**: 2,042 wards in final batch
- **Previously Imported**: 1,209 wards (13 provinces)
- **Import Success Rate**: ~98.7%
- **Geometry Validation Errors**: 43 wards

### 🏙️ Coverage by Province

All 34 provinces/municipalities of Vietnam have been successfully imported:

- thành phố Hồ Chí Minh: 167 wards
- tỉnh Thanh Hóa: 166 wards
- tỉnh Phú Thọ: 148 wards
- tỉnh Nghệ An: 130 wards
- tỉnh Ninh Bình: 129 wards
- [Additional 29 provinces with full ward coverage]

### 🗺️ Geometry Data Quality

- **MultiPolygon Format**: Primary geometry type for administrative boundaries
- **Coordinate System**: Standard geographic coordinates (longitude, latitude)
- **Data Validation**: 43 geometry validation errors identified (duplicate vertices, invalid loops)
- **Usability**: 97.97% of wards have valid geometric boundaries

### 📁 Technical Implementation

- **Database**: MongoDB with indexed geometry fields
- **Model**: Ward schema with geographic 2dsphere indexing
- **Processing**: Batch processing (50 wards per batch) with error handling
- **Scripts Created**:
  - `import-remaining-provinces.ts` - Automated import for all provinces
  - `check-import-status.ts` - Status verification
  - Various analysis and cleanup scripts

## 🚀 Next Development Phase
