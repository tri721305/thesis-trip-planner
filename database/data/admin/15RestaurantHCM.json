The restaurant opens at 6PM, and we arrived a little after 6PM, so it was very empty, but around 7PM, it was pretty busy! We visited on a Monday for the Mega Monday deal ‚ò∫Ô∏è\nThe food was great; We wanted to try many dishes, and my mother greatly enjoyed the lobster in truffle cream sauce. We went to order the lobster, but we do not speak Vietnamese, and the chef does not seem to speak English. However, a server in black suit quickly rushed to us and helped us order in fluent English. We greatly appreciated her help! This is not our first time here, and all the servers here are very professional and helpful üåü\nI highly recommend getting the grilled lobster in spicy cheese or grilled scallop in spicy cheese üåüüåü\nThe dessert section was also great! I liked the peanut butter chocolate mousse ‚ò∫Ô∏è\nThe interior design is also quite beautiful üåü"

I enjoyed their salad bar with a good variety of dressings, and high-quality cheese, but nothing beat their Cantonese menu with all the popular dishes you can find. The Cantonese line was the first to run out when I was there so the people agreed with me. Other line of food was ok, not too wow or fab.\n\nThe server and the overall atmosphere were nice to me, but for a 5-star hotel, the space feels lil bit tight, tables were pretty close to each other.\n\nI think for the same price and luxurious experience, but better quality food, you can find other places in the same area."

This place has a great ambience, vibe and fitout that doesn't feel like a regular hotel venue. It feels a cross between the local market, food hall and buffet stand with a beautiful relaxed space. The staff here are super friendly, helpful and attentive. The food on offer is fresh and has a large variety and diversity to local food and western. Definitely recommend a visit, you won't leave hungry or disappointed"

They had trouble Cutting and serving the meats properly. My biggest was the noise level. The staff had decorated all the tables with blow whistles and clackers to celebrate Christmas. We were sat next to a family of 3 small children. The children kept running around the tables yelling and blowing the whistles and clackers. It felt like a kid‚Äôs birthday party at Chuck E Cheese not a 5 star buffet. It totally ruined the meal for me."

Since my friends come a bit late I ordered Pepsi to drink and some dishes first. However I had been waiting for 15 mins just for a can of Pepsi. After few times friendly remind about food they brought me 3 dishes of beef and then again another waiting. I know that's they are a bit busy because lots of people come to eat as year end parties but I wait for so long and my grill mat isn't good enough so my food is stuck with some coal dust. Therefore I had to repeat myself several times to get it changed. When I come to a BUFFET restaurant I expect that food is served quickly and plentifuly because I pay a lot to eat freely and comfortably. I would never come back to this place."

the top part here is over there I mean I've been to all you eat you hop up her face and I been to all-you-can-eat buffets I never seen them together and this is just incredible quality of ingredients you know this is a marriage made in buffet hotpot heaven this is a true station for you this choco drew mystery all the seafood here and the lobster we have more than night the recipe to cook and we serve the lobster at the table i order from the table you guys cook it the way I want and bring the lobster to my table just see thank you so much my friend I'm gonna I'm gonna get my eat on so I'm gonna get started I formulated a plan I'm thinking the first thing I need to do is order some lobsters and hi so what kind of lobsters do you have again grow with cheese that's a Chinese style well I won't go with cheese and then with chilli so that's like Singapore chilli crab almost so how long would that be five minutes I got five minutes to go get my other stuff I can do this thank you so much let's go mussels this spring roll looks like it has Chinese sausage inside I love China inside and I definitely need one with shrimp inside and steam roll for sure okay I think that's all I can fit in this plate let's put this back and get into play Oh my lobsters here wow what great timing huh got my lobster got my plate oh that's barbecue real well let's just dig in cuz lobster waits for no man when you see hot lobster in front of ya you gotta pay us some attention immediately that tastes almost exactly like the chili crap I had in Singapore at chef war well it's a lobster it's sweet a little eggy not very spicy at all Oh ma'am my lobster is so fresh which is like the slops you just swim to my plate and I just want to make sure I get that meat all over that delicious chili eggy sauce this is insane - it makes sense right it tastes good on crab why not officer and I don't even know how to even begin with it I feel like I'm gonna first date right now I'm just so overwhelmed I'm intimidated by this buffet by how many things I want to try on this buffet let's just crack open a claw let's burn it now right now by the way you know what I was kind of wondering like what kind of sauce I should dip this in and yeah is what tastes good with some sauce maybe like a little spicy mayo or something but as is this is already delicious and on this home it just has too sweet briny flavor excuse me what what do you dip this in usually oh thank you thank you it's so nice here I never seen a buffet where the crab is literally alive right before they cook it is a live one of effect this is as fresh as you can ever get thank you so much so you put this over some chili some lime in some salt and pepper dip it in the sauce oh wow that's perfect for crab its citrusy peppery spicy and it doesn't take away from the sweetness of the crab meat itself oh thank you sure what she's lobsters are here I've talked about she's lobsters before because always used to have them at Chinese banquets and I never see them cooked really anywhere else before especially not at about face cuz usually you go to a buffet even if there is lobster it's usually steamed or boiled and maybe sometimes grilled and I'll tell you guys this is my favorite way to eat lobster I can't believe they'd do that here on an all-you-can-eat buffet I can have as much of this as I want I'm starting out with pork sorry crab let's just you for a second look at this guy's straight out of the oven I gotta pick this up I know it's hot but oh you can taste the smoke definitely taste the cheese mix with that beautifully sweet lobster meat Music you ever seen Lobster do that before she goes so good with lobster that's why I lobster mac and cheese work so well no it's good another one going oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah we don't need anything else there's just real apps for me wrapped all in this gooey cheese once you guys tried this way of preparing Lobster trust me you're gonna absolutely love it Music so perfect this is literally the third Lobster I'm finishing right now I'm just gonna tip it a little bit in the sauce for my crab because then it's gonna a little too cheesy for me haha but how much I love romantic comedies I didn't think that was possible but that citrus and chilli on the lobster means that I could probably eat like double the amount of lobster than usual okay I'm gonna hit pause on the seat but just because this is all sitting here I want to try this out first this little cocktail shrimp with a little lime and it looks like sriracha mayo in some dill oh one dwarf mmm spicy mayo I feel like it has a little ketchup in here yeah and there's a little Chandi yes it's a cute little cheese sandwich shaped like a little football there's some some sweet onions we're jamming here we're delicious you know I'd make it better add a little lobster me to here somebody loves lobster sandwich now it's shoes on cheese on lobster you know that's gonna be good I'm behind this baby for what looks like maybe some lettuce a little toaster hmm everything I had so far it's been superb superb I can't wait for this I think that's port near here shrimp beef noodles everything is so fresh all the ingredients still ridiculously fresh and well prepared all right I'm gonna wrap this up then we gonna go for round two at this moment this is the most valuable real estate you need but this this speaking duck dish that needs to get in here right now this is officers about the sauce fish sauce can never be wasted never I don't even care but the breads gonna fill up my stomach I don't it's that good I really hope that if you guys come to this buffet that they have this particular dish this might be one of the best things I've had out any buffet at any time anywhere I would pay money for this at a restaurant like no questions asked I don't know what this is but I mean it's here I'm gonna dip it a little bit again excuse me I'll be right back yeah I had to right away get another plate of this thing you do with some of the fruits this time I just can't get over how ridiculous this dish is unbelievably good I think also that there's bits of peppercorn here to get some of that nice numbing flavor there's just a greater stamp all right plate number four we're going after the main dishes here I can order a bit in these noodle soup okay so here this kinda like a like a Mongolian style barbecue supper with much better ingredients my chance is thank you this is a noodle soup gonna add some scallions a little bit of gel Thai chili pepper corn there's a tiny bit lime and you said a little bit of sriracha like tiny bit and then my stir-fried noodles gonna be done in about five minutes thank you here we go oh I can't wait for this to customize noodles one soup one stir-frying the soups got a couple pieces of corn here oh the beautiful wide rice noodles I have fun before this tastes a lot like the crab noodle soup I had on the middle port and I love how citrusy the Super Soaker ah it takes borderline like a Tom Yum soup and no wonder they call this Vietnamese rule golf these noodles are the same size as udon noodles but of course this is made with rice Music for production I know I'm eating a lot of dishes that fill up a lot of room in my stomach but I got no regrets next up this is my own creation I didn't put a lot of things in here there's some mushrooms some onions and then just beef and a little it looks like egg noodles these noodles are assuring my expectations were really low because I'm thinking because it just looks like boring old egg noodles Wow double Wow first of all you don't cook perfectly chewy perfect degree of doneness in the sauce it seems like some sort of salty sauce worth actually no one piece sort of like that Vietnamese chili sauce I had from before but whatever this is it is highly addictive highly objective I never advocate going from you know that a buffet I certainly don't advocate going for a second helping of noodles out of up bay but I'm gonna down this now I'm going for a second ball wow those noodles now I need to go get this I think when you do this you put it onto your tray it's a massive wants could I get a shabu yeah that'd be great and then do I get this grilled somewhere oh yeah thank you oh come back and get both you got it see you soon and while we wait let's see if there's something I missed pork neck would muster was not here before Oh comforting look at this look at that doesn't that just look pretty pork neck with mustard and this also wasn't here stir-fried seafood a little bit of fried rice this should tide me over until my hot pots ready pork right but it tastes like those pigs that fight against those really angry birds because this is top hey sometime here so with the hotpot what you do is you put whatever you want on your place so I got some beef some random veggies I think one of those is mine yeah thank you today you can get some more sauce here so what they basically did was it just took the ingredients and they boiled it and you just dip it in the sauce first of all your goodies massive prawns Chuck on a hill Oh bet oh yeah I love it when they use wooden charcoal because the smoky flavor is so enhanced and I have some fish sauce and chili oh my gosh some candy actually human just without sauce I got an octopus I'm not sure why - Kendra hmm that's really good whoa that might be burning the shrimp in the shabu-shabu not really what I expected I thought you feel I got like a pot best that's kind expect a little too much here okay this is not a shabu shabu plays hold of me me just cut a little thick and they give you some sauce to go with it Music it's not half bad because the meat is sliced kinda thick it is a little tougher than I like but the quality of meat is good the sauce is nice I mean for a buffet I'll tell you what I've had worse than actual hot pot restaurants all right here guys I gotta see what time it is yep this there's our time I don't know what Fuji cake is all I know is I want something this looks good Oh cappuccino drink looking thing oh yeah I need this this might be the last one they had dessert round always bittersweet oh hopefully a more sweet than bitter this is something I'm happy for green bean soup is something that Chinese love and its really awesome a drink this was hot outside this is a dessert drink we pushed order in here but we never add seafood and I had this bizarre at another restaurant here of Vietnam it tastes pretty good Music this one does as well it's slightly funky bizarre the seaweed flavor is more pronounced here but stuff I love love mumbling subsides mum peanut green bean we call a noodle or Indian Chinese but it's really mombi all right pleasant as day this is ridiculously good it tastes a little bit like Chinese yogurt I'm a much swear a much prettier Music it's so good alright let's get to this cheers to a great buffet guys every single one of these beautifully designed plates that came out of a babe has been spectacular and this is no exception this ha player I think is raspberry jam the cake here in the middle it's firm but it breaks down really easily and when it goes into your mouth and my smack in the middle it's a layer of fruity I think maybe strawberry mousse the whole thing if tarp as sweet this buttery is a great way to wrap up this meal fantastic way to wrap up this meal well if you can't tell I kind of like this buffet and add up all the buffets I've ever been to this one probably had the freshest seafood and this is the only place I've ever seen that and especially the size place of food for you and those dishes not only look amazing they take - even better and I'm pretty sure when I say this that this is the best super buffet I've been to so far in my life and guys there's another reason this place is awesome just walk it around it if you ask me how much this buffet cost I will usually say 80 90 and maybe even a hundred dollars but this place 53 US dollars so yes I highly highly highly highly recommend this place so if you're ever in Saigon where you're ever in Vietnam but you know what if you're in the Southeast Asia region you need to come and eat at this place also I'll just think of this morning check this out I think I've determined that Saigon is one of the best cities in the world to go on a vacation here's watch plane ticket aside if you can find a time when the plane ticket it's not that much hotels Arabi and he's like nice ones in this city goes for like twenty thirty forty dollars so you get a cheap flight you come here and you book a nice hotel you book a nice Airbnb that's what I'm gonna run you thirty forty dollars a night then you only really need to budget like five to ten hours a day for food I mean what is that cheap in the city and is ridiculously good and then like one night you splurge a little bit you come here best vacation ever and guys as always the information for this place is listed in my description box thank y'all so much for watching thank you so much for joining me on this awesome seafood buffet adventure and I'm till we get again I'll see you later",

          "reviewText": "I recently had the pleasure of staying at Hotel Nikko Saigon in Ho Chi Minh City, and I must say it was an exceptional experience from start to finish. This five-star property truly lives up to its reputation for relaxation and refined Japanese hospitality.\n\nFrom the moment I arrived, I was greeted by the warm and professional staff at the front desk. Tracy, in particular, went above and beyond to ensure my check-in process was smooth and personalized. She took the time to explain all the hotel amenities and even offered recommendations for local attractions. Her attention to detail and genuine smile made me feel instantly welcome.\n\nThe room was absolutely stunning - spacious, modern, and impeccably clean with a minimalist design that created a sense of tranquility. The marble bathroom with its separate soaking tub and walk-in shower was luxurious, and I appreciated thoughtful touches like the electronic Toto toilet system and high-quality toiletries. The 42-inch flat-screen TV, complimentary high-speed Wi-Fi, and comfortable workstation made it perfect for both relaxation and business needs.\n\nOne of the highlights of my stay was dining at La Brasserie. The restaurant staff there deserves special recognition for their exceptional service. They were knowledgeable about every dish, attentive without being intrusive, and always ready with thoughtful recommendations. The international buffet breakfast was simply outstanding - possibly the widest selection I've ever seen at a hotel. Their seafood dinner buffet was equally impressive, featuring unlimited lobsters, crabs, and oysters that were fresh and delicious.\n\nI also had the opportunity to visit the 5 Senses restaurant on the ground floor, which offers modern Japanese cuisine with creative flair. The presentation of each dish was like a work of art, and the flavors were extraordinary. Again, the staff's expertise and friendly demeanor enhanced the dining experience.\n\nThe hotel's facilities are top-notch. The outdoor pool provided a peaceful retreat after a day of exploring the city. The fitness center was well-equipped with modern machines, and the spa services were rejuvenating. I particularly enjoyed spending time in the Nikko Club Lounge on the 23rd floor, which offers spectacular views of the city along with complimentary refreshments throughout the day.\n\nWhile the hotel is located slightly away from the main tourist areas, this actually became an advantage as it provided a peaceful sanctuary away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The complimentary shuttle service to major attractions made it convenient to explore Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nWhat truly sets Hotel Nikko Saigon apart is its staff. From the concierge team who helped arrange tours and transportation, to the housekeeping staff who maintained the room to perfection, to the attentive servers at all dining venues - everyone demonstrated the highest level of professionalism and genuine care for guests.\n\nHotel Nikko Saigon has definitely become my go-to accommodation in Ho Chi Minh City. The combination of luxurious amenities, exceptional dining options, and outstanding service makes it well worth the price. I'm already looking forward to my next visit!"

When I was enjoying Seafood buffet at while staying at the hotel, the roast beef was a bit too raw and tough for me. I cut off parts I did not like, and it was cleared by the server named Nguyen Yen Nhi. She looked closely at my plate and reported something to her manager. Then the manager Tran Van Than(Robert) came up to me and asked what I did not like about the food. He apologized for the food condition then offered me to bring some stake to my taste. Ms. Nguyen and Robert constantly looked after my table and were very attentive. Food was amazing, but the thing touched my heart  was staff's service level.\n\nThanks to their service I will strongly recommend my friends and family to stay at the Nikko Saigon, and to try the seafood buffet even if they don't stay at different hotel.\n\nThank you so much for perfecting my stay."

that tastes almost exactly like the chili crap I had in Singapore at chef war well it's a lobster it's sweet a little eggy not very spicy at all Oh ma'am my lobster is so fresh which is like the slops you just swim to my plate and I just want to make sure I get that meat all over that delicious chili eggy sauce this is insane - it makes sense right it tastes good on crab why not officer and I don't even know how to even begin with it I feel like I'm gonna first date right now I'm just so overwhelmed I'm intimidated by this buffet by how many things I want to try on this buffet let's just crack open a claw let's burn it now right now by the way you know what I was kind of wondering like what kind of sauce I should dip this in and yeah is what tastes good with some sauce maybe like a little spicy mayo or something but as is this is already delicious and on this home it just has too sweet briny flavor excuse me what what do you dip this in usually oh thank you thank you it's so nice here I never seen a buffet where the crab is literally alive right before they cook it is a live one of effect this is as fresh as you can ever get thank you so much so you put this over some chili some lime in some salt and pepper dip it in the sauce oh wow that's perfect for crab its citrusy peppery spicy and it doesn't take away from the sweetness of the crab meat itself oh thank you sure what she's lobsters are here I've talked about she's lobsters before because always used to have them at Chinese banquets and I never see them cooked really anywhere else before especially not at about face cuz usually you go to a buffet even if there is lobster it's usually steamed or boiled and maybe sometimes grilled and I'll tell you guys this is my favorite way to eat lobster I can't believe they'd do that here on an all-you-can-eat buffet I can have as much of this as I want I'm starting out with pork sorry crab let's just you for a second look at this guy's straight out of the oven I gotta pick this up I know it's hot but oh you can taste the smoke definitely taste the cheese mix with that beautifully sweet lobster meat Music you ever seen Lobster do that before she goes so good with lobster that's why I lobster mac and cheese work so well no it's good another one going oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah we don't need anything else there's just real apps for me wrapped all in this gooey cheese once you guys tried this way of preparing Lobster trust me you're gonna absolutely love it Music so perfect this is literally the third Lobster I'm finishing right now I'm just gonna tip it a little bit in the sauce for my crab because then it's gonna a little too cheesy for me haha but how much I love romantic comedies I didn't think that was possible but that citrus and chilli on the lobster means that I could probably eat like double the amount of lobster than usual okay I'm gonna hit pause on the seat but just because this is all sitting here I want to try this out first this little cocktail shrimp with a little lime and it looks like sriracha mayo in some dill oh one dwarf mmm spicy mayo I feel like it has a little ketchup in here yeah and there's a little Chandi yes it's a cute little cheese sandwich shaped like a little football there's some some sweet onions we're jamming here we're delicious you know I'd make it better add a little lobster me to here somebody loves lobster sandwich now it's shoes on cheese on lobster you know that's gonna be good I'm behind this baby for what looks like maybe some lettuce a little toaster hmm everything I had so far it's been superb superb I can't wait for this I think that's port near here shrimp beef noodles everything is so fresh all the ingredients still ridiculously fresh and well prepared all right I'm gonna wrap this up then we gonna go for round two at this moment this is the most valuable real estate you need but this this speaking duck dish that needs to get in here right now this is officers about the sauce fish sauce can never be wasted never I don't even care but the breads gonna fill up my stomach I don't it's that good I really hope that if you guys come to this buffet that they have this particular dish this might be one of the best things I've had out any buffet at any time anywhere I would pay money for this at a restaurant like no questions asked I don't know what this is but I mean it's here I'm gonna dip it a little bit again excuse me I'll be right back yeah I had to right away get another plate of this thing you do with some of the fruits this time I just can't get over how ridiculous this dish is unbelievably good I think also that there's bits of peppercorn here to get some of that nice numbing flavor there's just a greater stamp all right plate number four we're going after the main dishes here I can order a bit in these noodle soup okay so here this kinda like a like a Mongolian style barbecue supper with much better ingredients my chance is thank you this is a noodle soup gonna add some scallions a little bit of gel Thai chili pepper corn there's a tiny bit lime and you said a little bit of sriracha like tiny bit and then my stir-fried noodles gonna be done in about five minutes thank you here we go oh I can't wait for this to customize noodles one soup one stir-frying the soups got a couple pieces of corn here oh the beautiful wide rice noodles I have fun before this tastes a lot like the crab noodle soup I had on the middle port and I love how citrusy the Super Soaker ah it takes borderline like a Tom Yum soup and no wonder they call this Vietnamese rule golf these noodles are the same size as udon noodles but of course this is made with rice Music for production I know I'm eating a lot of dishes that fill up a lot of room in my stomach but I got no regrets next up this is my own creation I didn't put a lot of things in here there's some mushrooms some onions and then just beef and a little it looks like egg noodles these noodles are assuring my expectations were really low because I'm thinking because it just looks like boring old egg noodles Wow double Wow first of all you don't cook perfectly chewy perfect degree of doneness in the sauce it seems like some sort of salty sauce worth actually no one piece sort of like that Vietnamese chili sauce I had from before but whatever this is it is highly addictive highly objective I never advocate going from you know that a buffet I certainly don't advocate going for a second helping of noodles out of up bay but I'm gonna down this now I'm going for a second ball wow those noodles now I need to go get this I think when you do this you put it onto your tray it's a massive wants could I get a shabu yeah that'd be great and then do I get this grilled somewhere oh yeah thank you oh come back and get both you got it see you soon and while we wait let's see if there's something I missed pork neck would muster was not here before Oh comforting look at this look at that doesn't that just look pretty pork neck with mustard and this also wasn't here stir-fried seafood a little bit of fried rice this should tide me over until my hot pots ready pork right but it tastes like those pigs that fight against those really angry birds because this is top hey sometime here so with the hotpot what you do is you put whatever you want on your place so I got some beef some random veggies I think one of those is mine yeah thank you today you can get some more sauce here so what they basically did was it just took the ingredients and they boiled it and you just dip it in the sauce first of all your goodies massive prawns Chuck on a hill Oh bet oh yeah I love it when they use wooden charcoal because the smoky flavor is so enhanced and I have some fish sauce and chili oh my gosh some candy actually human just without sauce I got an octopus I'm not sure why - Kendra hmm that's really good whoa that might be burning the shrimp in the shabu-shabu not really what I expected I thought you feel I got like a pot best that's kind expect a little too much here okay this is not a shabu shabu plays hold of me me just cut a little thick and they give you some sauce to go with it Music it's not half bad because the meat is sliced kinda thick it is a little tougher than I like but the quality of meat is good the sauce is nice I mean for a buffet I'll tell you what I've had worse than actual hot pot restaurants all right here guys I gotta see what time it is yep this there's our time I don't know what Fuji cake is all I know is I want something this looks good Oh cappuccino drink looking thing oh yeah I need this this might be the last one they had dessert round always bittersweet oh hopefully a more sweet than bitter this is something I'm happy for green bean soup is something that Chinese love and its really awesome a drink this was hot outside this is a dessert drink we pushed order in here but we never add seafood and I had this bizarre at another restaurant here of Vietnam it tastes pretty good Music this one does as well it's slightly funky bizarre the seaweed flavor is more pronounced here but stuff I love love mumbling subsides mum peanut green bean we call a noodle or Indian Chinese but it's really mombi all right pleasant as day this is ridiculously good it tastes a little bit like Chinese yogurt I'm a much swear a much prettier Music it's so good alright let's get to this cheers to a great buffet guys every single one of these beautifully designed plates that came out of a babe has been spectacular and this is no exception this ha player I think is raspberry jam the cake here in the middle it's firm but it breaks down really easily and when it goes into your mouth and my smack in the middle it's a layer of fruity I think maybe strawberry mousse the whole thing if tarp as sweet this buttery is a great way to wrap up this meal fantastic way to wrap up this meal well if you can't tell I kind of like this buffet and add up all the buffets I've ever been to this one probably had the freshest seafood and this is the only place I've ever seen that and especially the size place of food for you and those dishes not only look amazing they take - even better and I'm pretty sure when I say this that this is the best super buffet I've been to so far in my life and guys there's another reason this place is awesome just walk it around it if you ask me how much this buffet cost I will usually say 80 90 and maybe even a hundred dollars but this place 53 US dollars so yes I highly highly highly highly recommend this place so if you're ever in Saigon where you're ever in Vietnam but you know what if you're in the Southeast Asia region you need to come and eat at this place also I'll just think of this morning check this out I think I've determined that Saigon is one of the best cities in the world to go on a vacation here's watch plane ticket aside if you can find a time when the plane ticket it's not that much hotels Arabi and he's like nice ones in this city goes for like twenty thirty forty dollars so you get a cheap flight you come here and you book a nice hotel you book a nice Airbnb that's what I'm gonna run you thirty forty dollars a night then you only really need to budget like five to ten hours a day for food I mean what is that cheap in the city and is ridiculously good and then like one night you splurge a little bit you come here best vacation ever and guys as always the information for this place is listed in my description box thank y'all so much for watching thank you so much for joining me on this awesome seafood buffet adventure and I'm till we get again I'll see you later",

I tried the one with broccoli, apples, raisins, and chicken, and the combination was delicious. The vegetables were crisp, and the fruits added a perfect balance of sweetness.\nThe portion size was generous. If you‚Äôre looking for a healthy, tasty meal, Delisa is definitely a must-try! Highly recommended for anyone craving fresh and nutritious food in a cozy setting."

The staff are very friendly, they explained quite carefully the menu though I asked a lot (Sorry for too much question). The store is quite small and too simple for chilling but good enough to take a quick lunch or dinner.My favourite is Caesar salad, the sauce is so nice. You can also choose your own ingredients by order Myown salad which I highly appreciate.\nI also recommend the Avocado Shrimp salad since their pesto sauce is best in the town. They charge more and give you one full sauce box if you ask for more sauce. So the sauce is not free but it's fair."

bring the lobster to my table just see thank you so much my friend I'm gonna I'm gonna get my eat on so I'm gonna get started I formulated a plan I'm thinking the first thing I need to do is order some lobsters and hi so what kind of lobsters do you have again grow with cheese that's a Chinese style well I won't go with cheese and then with chilli so that's like Singapore chilli crab almost so how long would that be five minutes I got five minutes to go get my other stuff I can do this thank you so much let's go mussels this spring roll looks like it has Chinese sausage inside I love China inside and I definitely need one with shrimp inside and steam roll for sure okay I think that's all I can fit in this plate let's put this back and get into play Oh my lobsters here wow what great timing huh got my lobster got my plate oh that's barbecue real well let's just dig in cuz lobster waits for no man when you see hot lobster in front of ya you gotta pay us some attention immediately that tastes almost exactly like the chili crap I had in Singapore at chef war well it's a lobster it's sweet a little eggy not very spicy at all Oh ma'am my lobster is so fresh which is like the slops you just swim to my plate and I just want to make sure I get that meat all over that delicious chili eggy sauce this is insane - it makes sense right it tastes good on crab why not officer and I don't even know how to even begin with it I feel like I'm gonna first date right now I'm just so overwhelmed I'm intimidated by this buffet by how many things I want to try on this buffet let's just crack open a claw let's burn it now right now by the way you know what I was kind of wondering like what kind of sauce I should dip this in and yeah is what tastes good with some sauce maybe like a little spicy mayo or something but as is this is already delicious and on this home it just has too sweet briny flavor excuse me what what do you dip this in usually oh thank you thank you it's so nice here I never seen a buffet where the crab is literally alive right before they cook it is a live one of effect this is as fresh as you can ever get thank you so much so you put this over some chili some lime in some salt and pepper dip it in the sauce oh wow that's perfect for crab its citrusy peppery spicy and it doesn't take away from the sweetness of the crab meat itself oh thank you sure what she's lobsters are here I've talked about she's lobsters before because always used to have them at Chinese banquets and I never see them cooked really anywhere else before especially not at about face cuz usually you go to a buffet even if there is lobster it's usually steamed or boiled and maybe sometimes grilled and I'll tell you guys this is my favorite way to eat lobster I can't believe they'd do that here on an all-you-can-eat buffet I can have as much of this as I want I'm starting out with pork sorry crab let's just you for a second look at this guy's straight out of the oven I gotta pick this up I know it's hot but oh you can taste the smoke definitely taste the cheese mix with that beautifully sweet lobster meat Music you ever seen Lobster do that before she goes so good with lobster that's why I lobster mac and cheese work so well no it's good another one going oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah we don't need anything else there's just real apps for me wrapped all in this gooey cheese once you guys tried this way of preparing Lobster trust me you're gonna absolutely love it Music so perfect this is literally the third Lobster I'm finishing right now I'm just gonna tip it a little bit in the sauce for my crab because then it's gonna a little too cheesy for me haha but how much I love romantic comedies I didn't think that was possible but that citrus and chilli on the lobster means that I could probably eat like double the amount of lobster than usual okay I'm gonna hit pause on the seat but just because this is all sitting here I want to try this out first this little cocktail shrimp with a little lime and it looks like sriracha mayo in some dill oh one dwarf mmm spicy mayo I feel like it has a little ketchup in here yeah and there's a little Chandi yes it's a cute little cheese sandwich shaped like a little football there's some some sweet onions we're jamming here we're delicious you know I'd make it better add a little lobster me to here somebody loves lobster sandwich now it's shoes on cheese on lobster you know that's gonna be good I'm behind this baby for what looks like maybe some lettuce a little toaster hmm everything I had so far it's been superb superb I can't wait for this I think that's port near here shrimp beef noodles everything is so fresh all the ingredients still ridiculously fresh and well prepared all right I'm gonna wrap this up then we gonna go for round two at this moment this is the most valuable real estate you need but this this speaking duck dish that needs to get in here right now this is officers about the sauce fish sauce can never be wasted never I don't even care but the breads gonna fill up my stomach I don't it's that good I really hope that if you guys come to this buffet that they have this particular dish this might be one of the best things I've had out any buffet at any time anywhere I would pay money for this at a restaurant like no questions asked I don't know what this is but I mean it's here I'm gonna dip it a little bit again excuse me I'll be right back yeah I had to right away get another plate of this thing you do with some of the fruits this time I just can't get over how ridiculous this dish is unbelievably good I think also that there's bits of peppercorn here to get some of that nice numbing flavor there's just a greater stamp all right plate number four we're going after the main dishes here I can order a bit in these noodle soup okay so here this kinda like a like a Mongolian style barbecue supper with much better ingredients my chance is thank you this is a noodle soup gonna add some scallions a little bit of gel Thai chili pepper corn there's a tiny bit lime and you said a little bit of sriracha like tiny bit and then my stir-fried noodles gonna be done in about five minutes thank you here we go oh I can't wait for this to customize noodles one soup one stir-frying the soups got a couple pieces of corn here oh the beautiful wide rice noodles I have fun before this tastes a lot like the crab noodle soup I had on the middle port and I love how citrusy the Super Soaker ah it takes borderline like a Tom Yum soup and no wonder they call this Vietnamese rule golf these noodles are the same size as udon noodles but of course this is made with rice Music for production I know I'm eating a lot of dishes that fill up a lot of room in my stomach but I got no regrets next up this is my own creation I didn't put a lot of things in here there's some mushrooms some onions and then just beef and a little it looks like egg noodles these noodles are assuring my expectations were really low because I'm thinking because it just looks like boring old egg noodles Wow double Wow first of all you don't cook perfectly chewy perfect degree of doneness in the sauce it seems like some sort of salty sauce worth actually no one piece sort of like that Vietnamese chili sauce I had from before but whatever this is it is highly addictive highly objective I never advocate going from you know that a buffet I certainly don't advocate going for a second helping of noodles out of up bay but I'm gonna down this now I'm going for a second ball wow those noodles now I need to go get this I think when you do this you put it onto your tray it's a massive wants could I get a shabu yeah that'd be great and then do I get this grilled somewhere oh yeah thank you oh come back and get both you got it see you soon and while we wait let's see if there's something I missed pork neck would muster was not here before Oh comforting look at this look at that doesn't that just look pretty pork neck with mustard and this also wasn't here stir-fried seafood a little bit of fried rice this should tide me over until my hot pots ready pork right but it tastes like those pigs that fight against those really angry birds because this is top hey sometime here so with the hotpot what you do is you put whatever you want on your place so I got some beef some random veggies I think one of those is mine yeah thank you today you can get some more sauce here so what they basically did was it just took the ingredients and they boiled it and you just dip it in the sauce first of all your goodies massive prawns Chuck on a hill Oh bet oh yeah I love it when they use wooden charcoal because the smoky flavor is so enhanced and I have some fish sauce and chili oh my gosh some candy actually human just without sauce I got an octopus I'm not sure why - Kendra hmm that's really good whoa that might be burning the shrimp in the shabu-shabu not really what I expected I thought you feel I got like a pot best that's kind expect a little too much here okay this is not a shabu shabu plays hold of me me just cut a little thick and they give you some sauce to go with it Music it's not half bad because the meat is sliced kinda thick it is a little tougher than I like but the quality of meat is good the sauce is nice I mean for a buffet I'll tell you what I've had worse than actual hot pot restaurants all right here guys I gotta see what time it is yep this there's our time I don't know what Fuji cake is all I know is I want something this looks good Oh cappuccino drink looking thing oh yeah I need this this might be the last one they had dessert round always bittersweet oh hopefully a more sweet than bitter this is something I'm happy for green bean soup is something that Chinese love and its really awesome a drink this was hot outside this is a dessert drink we pushed order in here but we never add seafood and I had this bizarre at another restaurant here of Vietnam it tastes pretty good Music this one does as well it's slightly funky bizarre the seaweed flavor is more pronounced here but stuff I love love mumbling subsides mum peanut green bean we call a noodle or Indian Chinese but it's really mombi all right pleasant as day this is ridiculously good it tastes a little bit like Chinese yogurt I'm a much swear a much prettier Music it's so good alright let's get to this cheers to a great buffet guys every single one of these beautifully designed plates that came out of a babe has been spectacular and this is no exception this ha player I think is raspberry jam the cake here in the middle it's firm but it breaks down really easily and when it goes into your mouth and my smack in the middle it's a layer of fruity I think maybe strawberry mousse the whole thing if tarp as sweet this buttery is a great way to wrap up this meal fantastic way to wrap up this meal well if you can't tell I kind of like this buffet and add up all the buffets I've ever been to this one probably had the freshest seafood and this is the only place I've ever seen that and especially the size place of food for you and those dishes not only look amazing they take - even better and I'm pretty sure when I say this that this is the best super buffet I've been to so far in my life and guys there's another reason this place is awesome just walk it around it if you ask me how much this buffet cost I will usually say 80 90 and maybe even a hundred dollars but this place 53 US dollars so yes I highly highly highly highly recommend this place so if you're ever in Saigon where you're ever in Vietnam but you know what if you're in the Southeast Asia region you need to come and eat at this place also I'll just think of this morning check this out I think I've determined that Saigon is one of the best cities in the world to go on a vacation here's watch plane ticket aside if you can find a time when the plane ticket it's not that much hotels Arabi and he's like nice ones in this city goes for like twenty thirty forty dollars so you get a cheap flight you come here and you book a nice hotel you book a nice Airbnb that's what I'm gonna run you thirty forty dollars a night then you only really need to budget like five to ten hours a day for food I mean what is that cheap in the city and is ridiculously good and then like one night you splurge a little bit you come here best vacation ever and guys as always the information for this place is listed in my description box thank y'all so much for watching thank you so much for joining me on this awesome seafood buffet adventure and I'm till we get again I'll see you later",

little bit in the sauce for my crab because then it's gonna a little too cheesy for me haha but how much I love romantic comedies I didn't think that was possible but that citrus and chilli on the lobster means that I could probably eat like double the amount of lobster than usual okay I'm gonna hit pause on the seat but just because this is all sitting here I want to try this out first this little cocktail shrimp with a little lime and it looks like sriracha mayo in some dill oh one dwarf mmm spicy mayo I feel like it has a little ketchup in here yeah and there's a little Chandi yes it's

have fun before this tastes a lot like the crab noodle soup I had on the middle port and I love how citrusy the Super Soaker ah it takes borderline like a Tom Yum soup and no wonder they call this Vietnamese rule golf these noodles are the same size as udon noodles but of course this is made with rice Music for production I know I'm eating a lot of dishes that fill up a lot of room in my stomach but I got no regrets next up this is my own creation I didn't put a lot of things in here there's some mushrooms some onions and then just beef and a little it looks like egg noodles these noodles are assuring my expectations were really low because I'm thinking because it just looks like boring old egg noodles Wow double Wow first of all you don't cook perfectly chewy perfect degree of doneness in the sauce it seems like some sort of salty sauce worth actually no one piece sort of like that Vietnamese chili sauce I had from before but whatever this is it is highly addictive highly objective I never advocate going from you know that a buffet I certainly don't advocate going for a second helping of noodles out of up bay but I'm gonna down this now I'm going for a second ball wow

some random veggies I think one of those is mine yeah thank you today you can get some more sauce here so what they basically did was it just took the ingredients and they boiled it and you just dip it in the sauce first of all your goodies massive prawns Chuck on a hill Oh bet oh yeah I love it when they use wooden charcoal because the smoky flavor is so enhanced and I have some fish sauce and chili oh my gosh some candy actually human just without sauce I got an octopus I'm not sure why - Kendra hmm that's really good whoa that might be burning the shrimp in the shabu-shabu not really what I expected I thought you feel I got like a pot best that's kind expect a little too much here okay this is not a shabu shabu plays hold of me me just cut a little thick and they give you some sauce to go with it Music it's not half bad because the meat is sliced kinda thick it is a little tougher than I like but the quality of meat is good the sauce is nice I mean for a buffet I'll tell you what I've had worse than actual hot pot restaurants all right here guys I gotta see what time it is yep this there's our time I don't know what Fuji cake is all I know is I want something this looks good Oh cappuccino drink looking thing oh yeah I need this this might be the last one they had dessert round always bittersweet oh hopefully a more sweet than bitter this is something I'm happy for green bean soup is something that Chinese love and its really awesome a drink this was hot outside this is a dessert drink we pushed order in here but we never add seafood and I had this bizarre at another restaurant here of Vietnam it tastes pretty good Music this one does as well it's slightly funky bizarre the seaweed flavor is more pronounced here but stuff I love love mumbling subsides mum peanut green bean we call a noodle or Indian Chinese but it's really mombi all right pleasant as day this is ridiculously good it tastes a little bit like Chinese yogurt I'm a much swear a much prettier Music it's so good alright let's get to this cheers to a great buffet guys every single one of these beautifully designed plates that came out of a babe has been spectacular and this is no exception this ha player I think is raspberry jam the cake here in the middle it's firm but it breaks down really easily and when it goes into your mouth and my smack in the middle it's a layer of fruity I think maybe strawberry mousse the whole thing if tarp as sweet this buttery is a great way to wrap up this meal fantastic way to wrap up this meal well if you can't tell I kind of like this buffet and add up all the buffets I've ever been to this one probably had the freshest seafood and this is the only place I've ever seen that and especially the size place of food for you and those dishes not only look amazing they take - even better and I'm pretty sure when I say this that this is the best super buffet I've been to so far in my life and guys there's another reason this place is awesome just walk it around it if you ask me how much this buffet cost I will usually say 80 90 and maybe even a hundred dollars but this place 53 US dollars so yes I highly highly highly highly recommend this place so if you're ever in Saigon where you're ever in Vietnam but you know what if you're in the Southeast Asia region you need to come and eat at this place also I'll just think of this morning check this out I think I've determined that Saigon is one of the best cities in the world to go on a vacation here's watch plane ticket aside if you can find a time when the plane ticket it's not that much hotels Arabi and he's like nice ones in this city goes for like twenty thirty forty dollars so you get a cheap flight you come here and you book a nice hotel you book a nice Airbnb that's what I'm gonna run you thirty forty dollars a night then you only really need to budget like five to ten hours a day for food I mean what is that cheap in the city and is ridiculously good and then like one night you splurge a little bit you come here best vacation ever and guys as always the information for this place is listed in my description box thank y'all so much for watching thank you so much for joining me on this awesome seafood buffet adventure and I'm till we get again I'll see you later",

          "snippet": "I'm gonna be the first in line here okay let's go stay here in anticipation Music guys I've been to a lot about face in my day you know I have and those are my favorite and just I'm a little speechless because I'm feeling kind of overwhelmed I gotta just show you because I took a quick walk around this buffet I'm getting chills you can't see right now but I got goose bumps going on my friend Viet here hey Viet how you doing so this is all seafood here appetizer we always stick the fest always Stefan Thanks fresh oyster from French yes cannabase it's finger food finger food matches appetizing Catherine Mercer from New Zealand he with tartar sauce so much variety it's not just simply like gonna get us to get some salad and thrown into a place smoked salmon from Scotland this is like a combination of just different foods around from around the world what is that steamed cake and she's rolling it in she like a fresh spring roll here salad bar cheese kind of we're gonna we're gonna bypass the Sally's a little bit because they're more exciting stuff ahead of us I promise you guys that this is crazy they have paging doctor the Peking duck and it's served like this yes you already with the chef he was hit over on preparation to cook for you and after that just speak up to your table and enjoy you brought to my table this looks like something I will get at a four or five-star restaurant look this there's no way this looks like something I get from a buffet like zero never seen it before you haven't seen the most exciting part yet there's a part in this buffet that I'm so excited about let's keep going let's go inside you have hot pot at a buffet yeah the top part here is over there I mean I've been to all you eat you hop up her face and I been to all-you-can-eat buffets I never seen them together and this is just incredible quality of ingredients you know this is a marriage made in buffet hotpot heaven this is a true station for you this choco drew mystery all the seafood here and the lobster we have more than night the recipe to cook and we serve the lobster at the table i order from the table you guys cook it the way I want and bring the lobster to my table just see thank you so much my friend I'm gonna I'm gonna get my eat on so I'm gonna get started I formulated a plan I'm thinking the first thing I need to do is order some lobsters and hi so what kind of lobsters do you have again grow with cheese that's a Chinese style well I won't go with cheese and then with chilli so that's like Singapore chilli crab almost so how long would that be five minutes I got five minutes to go get my other stuff I can do this thank you so much let's go mussels this spring roll looks like it has Chinese sausage inside I love China inside and I definitely need one with shrimp inside and steam roll for sure okay I think that's all I can fit in this plate let's put this back and get into play Oh my lobsters here wow what great timing huh got my lobster got my plate oh that's barbecue real well let's just dig in cuz lobster waits for no man when you see hot lobster in front of ya you gotta pay us some attention immediately that tastes almost exactly like the chili crap I had in Singapore at chef war well it's a lobster it's sweet a little eggy not very spicy at all Oh ma'am my lobster is so fresh which is like the slops you just swim to my plate and I just want to make sure I get that meat all over that delicious chili eggy sauce this is insane - it makes sense right it tastes good on crab why not officer and I don't even know how to even begin with it I feel like I'm gonna first date right now I'm just so overwhelmed I'm intimidated by this buffet by how many things I want to try on this buffet let's just crack open a claw let's burn it now right now by the way you know what I was kind of wondering like what kind of sauce I should dip this in and yeah is what tastes good with some sauce maybe like a little spicy mayo or something but as is this is already delicious and on this home it just has too sweet briny flavor excuse me what what do you dip this in usually oh thank you thank you it's so nice here I never seen a buffet where the crab is literally alive right before they cook it is a live one of effect this is as fresh as you can ever get thank you so much so you put this over some chili some lime in some salt and pepper dip it in the sauce oh wow that's perfect for crab its citrusy peppery spicy and it doesn't take away from the sweetness of the crab meat itself oh thank you sure what she's lobsters are here I've talked about she's lobsters before because always used to have them at Chinese banquets and I never see them cooked really anywhere else before especially not at about face cuz usually you go to a buffet even if there is lobster it's usually steamed or boiled and maybe sometimes grilled and I'll tell you guys this is my favorite way to eat lobster I can't believe they'd do that here on an all-you-can-eat buffet I can have as much of this as I want I'm starting out with pork sorry crab let's just you for a second look at this guy's straight out of the oven I gotta pick this up I know it's hot but oh you can taste the smoke definitely taste the cheese mix with that beautifully sweet lobster meat Music you ever seen Lobster do that before she goes so good with lobster that's why I lobster mac and cheese work so well no it's good another one going oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah we don't need anything else there's just real apps for me wrapped all in this gooey cheese once you guys tried this way of preparing Lobster trust me you're gonna absolutely love it Music so perfect this is literally the third Lobster I'm finishing right now I'm just gonna tip it a little bit in the sauce for my crab because then it's gonna a little too cheesy for me haha but how much I love romantic comedies I didn't think that was possible but that citrus and chilli on the lobster means that I could probably eat like double the amount of lobster than usual okay I'm gonna hit pause on the seat but just because this is all sitting here I want to try this out first this little cocktail shrimp with a little lime and it looks like sriracha mayo in some dill oh one dwarf mmm spicy mayo I feel like it has a little ketchup in here yeah and there's a little Chandi yes it's a cute little cheese sandwich shaped like a little football there's some some sweet onions we're jamming here we're delicious you know I'd make it better add a little lobster me to here somebody loves lobster sandwich now it's shoes on cheese on lobster you know that's gonna be good I'm behind this baby for what looks like maybe some lettuce a little toaster hmm everything I had so far it's been superb superb I can't wait for this I think that's port near here shrimp beef noodles everything is so fresh all the ingredients still ridiculously fresh and well prepared all right I'm gonna wrap this up then we gonna go for round two at this moment this is the most valuable real estate you need but this this speaking duck dish that needs to get in here right now this is officers about the sauce fish sauce can never be wasted never I don't even care but the breads gonna fill up my stomach I don't it's that good I really hope that if you guys come to this buffet that they have this particular dish this might be one of the best things I've had out any buffet at any time anywhere I would pay money for this at a restaurant like no questions asked I don't know what this is but I mean it's here I'm gonna dip it a little bit again excuse me I'll be right back yeah I had to right away get another plate of this thing you do with some of the fruits this time I just can't get over how ridiculous this dish is unbelievably good I think also that there's bits of peppercorn here to get some of that nice numbing flavor there's just a greater stamp all right plate number four we're going after the main dishes here I can order a bit in these noodle soup okay so here this kinda like a like a Mongolian style barbecue supper with much better ingredients my chance is thank you this is a noodle soup gonna add some scallions a little bit of gel Thai chili pepper corn there's a tiny bit lime and you said a little bit of sriracha like tiny bit and then my stir-fried noodles gonna be done in about five minutes thank you here we go oh I can't wait for this to customize noodles one soup one stir-frying the soups got a couple pieces of corn here oh the beautiful wide rice noodles I have fun before this tastes a lot like the crab noodle soup I had on the middle port and I love how citrusy the Super Soaker ah it takes borderline like a Tom Yum soup and no wonder they call this Vietnamese rule golf these noodles are the same size as udon noodles but of course this is made with rice Music for production I know I'm eating a lot of dishes that fill up a lot of room in my stomach but I got no regrets next up this is my own creation I didn't put a lot of things in here there's some mushrooms some onions and then just beef and a little it looks like egg noodles these noodles are assuring my expectations were really low because I'm thinking because it just looks like boring old egg noodles Wow double Wow first of all you don't cook perfectly chewy perfect degree of doneness in the sauce it seems like some sort of salty sauce worth actually no one piece sort of like that Vietnamese chili sauce I had from before but whatever this is it is highly addictive highly objective I never advocate going from you know that a buffet I certainly don't advocate going for a second helping of noodles out of up bay but I'm gonna down this now I'm going for a second ball wow those noodles now I need to go get this I think when you do this you put it onto your tray it's a massive wants could I get a shabu yeah that'd be great and then do I get this grilled somewhere oh yeah thank you oh come back and get both you got it see you soon and while we wait let's see if there's something I missed pork neck would muster was not here before Oh comforting look at this look at that doesn't that just look pretty pork neck with mustard and this also wasn't here stir-fried seafood a little bit of fried rice this should tide me over until my hot pots ready pork right but it tastes like those pigs that fight against those really angry birds because this is top hey sometime here so with the hotpot what you do is you put whatever you want on your place so I got some beef some random veggies I think one of those is mine yeah thank you today you can get some more sauce here so what they basically did was it just took the ingredients and they boiled it and you just dip it in the sauce first of all your goodies massive prawns Chuck on a hill Oh bet oh yeah I love it when they use wooden charcoal because the smoky flavor is so enhanced and I have some fish sauce and chili oh my gosh some candy actually human just without sauce I got an octopus I'm not sure why - Kendra hmm that's really good whoa that might be burning the shrimp in the shabu-shabu not really what I expected I thought you feel I got like a pot best that's kind expect a little too much here okay this is not a shabu shabu plays hold of me me just cut a little thick and they give you some sauce to go with it Music it's not half bad because the meat is sliced kinda thick it is a little tougher than I like but the quality of meat is good the sauce is nice I mean for a buffet I'll tell you what

Music it's so good alright let's get to this cheers to a great buffet guys every single one of these beautifully designed plates that came out of a babe has been spectacular and this is no exception this ha player I think is raspberry jam the cake here in the middle it's firm but it breaks down really easily and when it goes into your mouth and my smack in the middle it's a layer of fruity I think maybe strawberry mousse the whole thing if tarp as sweet this buttery is a great way to wrap up this meal fantastic way to wrap up this meal well if you can't tell I kind of like this buffet and add up all the buffets I've ever been to this one probably had the freshest seafood and this is the only place I've ever seen that and especially the size place of food for you and those dishes not only look amazing they take - even better and I'm pretty sure when I say this that this is the best super buffet I've been to so far in my life and guys there's another reason this place is awesome just walk it around it if you ask me how much this buffet cost I will usually say 80 90 and maybe even a hundred dollars but this place 53 US dollars so yes I highly highly highly highly recommend this place so if you're ever in Saigon where you're ever in Vietnam but you know what if you're in the Southeast Asia region you need to come and eat at this place also I'll just think of this morning check this out I think I've determined that Saigon is one of the best cities in the world to go on a vacation here's watch plane ticket aside if you can find a time when the plane ticket it's not that much hotels Arabi and he's like nice ones in this city goes for like twenty thirty forty dollars so you get a cheap flight you come here and you book a nice hotel you book a nice Airbnb that's what I'm gonna run you thirty forty dollars a night then you only really need to budget like five to ten hours a day for food I mean what is that cheap in the city and is ridiculously good and then like one night you splurge a little bit you come here best vacation ever and guys as always the information for this place is listed in my description box thank y'all so much for watching thank you so much for joining me on this awesome seafood buffet adventure and I'm till we get again I'll see you later",

If someone like us doesn't book breakfast at the hotel, this allows us to explore the bars, pastry shops or cafes in the area in the morning and not always stay in the hotel, then in Ho Chi Minh walking in the morning is a spectacle, the atmosphere, the people getting ready for their work, in the preparation of food of every quality, flavor and aroma, seeing the human river on scooters heading to work, carrying everything on their scooters üõµ and parents accompanying their children even 5 on the scooter... how wonderful! ü§© . Returning to the place, making a very brief description, the pastries are good and also the various types of coffee both hot and cold.\n\nFOOD AND DRINKS:\nThe desserts are really good and also aesthetically pleasing, the croissants ü•ê are of different qualities with various fillings and there are different sizes from large to mignon and are served hot, the pastries are also good. The coffee ‚òïÔ∏è of various specialties, Vietnamese, American or Italian both hot and cold is excellent, however my favorite is the Vietnamese coffee. In addition to coffee, the desserts also have various juices and even sandwiches but I have never tried them.\n\nPRICE:\nTo get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow much it costs, one morning we ordered a hot Vietnamese coffee with milk‚òïÔ∏è, a cold coconut coffee, a large empty croissant ü•ê and two mignon croissants with cream filling and we spent about 3,500,000 dong (about 12 fr)\n\nEXTERIOR ENVIRONMENT:\nThe Buttery cake and cafe is located in a street in the center, near the famous Nguyen Hue Street in Ho Chi Minh, next to it there are many shops and other cafes, then the usual scooters üõµ parked everywhere on the sidewalk and the guard who controls them. The facade is a glass that you can see the inside and the sign is simple but aesthetically nice.\n\nINTERIOR AMBIENCE:\nWhen you enter you are immediately greeted by the pastry shop window and then there is the counter, it is a long and narrow place on several floors. The predominant colors are white and light brown and the armchairs and sofas are comfortable, even the furniture is tasteful. Then there is a staircase that goes up to the upper floors that lights up when you go up and gives a nice light effect.\n\nATMOSPHERE:\nThe atmosphere is relaxing, the light of the lamps is not annoying, with background songs üé∂ also these relaxing, the only thing is that the different times we went they were always the same songs.\n\nSERVICE:\nThe staff is all young, professional, kind and fast in the service. Well done üëè\n\nTO IMPROVE:\nEverything is good, the only advice is to change the background music every now and then, because after a few days you hear the same songs üé∂, which are beautiful, but then become boring."

There are many types of cakes with beautiful eye-catching shapes. However, the cakes are only suitable for taking virtual photos. Because the cakes we ordered all tasted very normal, not that delicious. The price is way too expensive maybe because the shop is located in the center of the city."

To avoid this, I guess it is best to use knife and fork on it.\n\nI thought the chocolate clam was solid. It was beautiful in presentation as well.\n\nThe staff here seem friendly and helpful.  The place was bright and clean.\n\nThe price point is on the expensive side but not too outrageous for tourists."
