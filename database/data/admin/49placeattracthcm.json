We had booked a tour group, and the bus picked us up from the Old Quarter, making the journey convenient. The ride itself was smooth, and after reaching the site, our guide walked us through the history of the tunnels, explaining how the Vietnamese soldiers dug them by hand using basic tools, enduring immense hardships. These tunnels played a crucial role in their victory during the Vietnam War, allowing them to outmaneuver and resist much stronger forces.\n\nThere are two tunnels that visitors can enter, and going inside was both thrilling and humbling. At times, you have to crawl through extremely narrow spaces, truly experiencing the conditions the Vietnamese soldiers endured. The guide led us through the tunnels, ensuring safety while sharing fascinating details about their strategy, survival techniques, and daily life underground.\n\nIt was a great and lasting experience, making history come alive in a way that books never could. Highly recommend this tour to anyone visiting Vietnam! After the tour, we were conveniently dropped back at the District 1, wrapping up an unforgettable day."

Learning about the Vietnam War on-site made everything feel so real and emotional. I was truly amazed by the creativity and resilience of the Vietnamese people—how they were able to live, move, and survive underground in such extreme conditions is just incredible. It’s a powerful reminder of how thinking outside the box can make the impossible possible.\n\nYou actually get to experience the tunnels yourself, and let me tell you—it’s intense! The temperature was around 22°C, which helped, but you still have to bend, squat, crawl, and slide your way through tight, narrow passages. It’s physically exhausting, but also really fun and totally worth it.\n\nOne of the highlights for me was the shooting range. You can try out some of the actual types of guns used during the war. I got to fire one, and it was both thrilling and surreal—like stepping straight into history.\n\nIf you're visiting Vietnam and want a deeper understanding of its history, this place is a must-see. Just wear comfy clothes and prepare for a unique, hands-on adventure!"

The museum was only 80,000 Dong each (~£2.30) to get in. We felt this was amazing value.\nBefore entering me and my girlfriend had no knowledge about the Vietnam war. However exiting 3 hours later we felt as thought we knew a lot. Inside the museum you can read the full timeline of the war. It’s quite distressing seeing what the Americans did and many people were quite emotional. There are photos which are very disturbing and show the extent of the pain the Vietnamese went through.\nOutside the building there were military vehicles and weapons which were fascinating to look at.\nOverall really glad we went and it has given us a real insight to the horrors that occurred.\nThis really is a must if you are visiting Ho Chi Minh City."

I imagine that the best way to do explore it would be from the third/second floor and going down, once the higher floor is about the earlier history of the country and the middle floor is much more dense about the war crimes. In my opinion this place is a must visit if you ever come to HCMC because it tells in so many details about the war and its history. Besides that, for all the westerns it’s an opportunity to get some knowledge besides that spread and teach in schools. I must say it’s a very dense visiting. I spent about 3h and wasn’t able to read everything"

The images are too graphic to post. But if you've ever fought in war, heard stories from family members who have, or have been associated in any way with the destruction that wars cause, then well... you get the picture. As an American it's unsettling but at the same time unifying to share the experience with people from all different countries (and perspectives), including Vietnamese. If you're not emotionally moved after visiting then I can't imagine you're human."

Found it hard to really absorb all the information due to the chaos of people around. Certainly not your typical \"museum\" atmosphere, but would still highly recommend.\nThere was a huge line for tickets stretching around the block, however I went with part of a private city tour and skipped the line entirely. Highly recommended doing it that way over just rocking up on a whim. As mentioned above, it was difficult to actually stand and read all the info, so having a private guide was certainly worth it!"

This is crowded place mixed with good and not so okay sellers. Since I had enough time on first day I noted prices of various items from my checklist and shop numbers. Have to agree with other reviewers that you need to bargain a lot and prices are 3x. No AC. I visited other markets like Saigon square and central market too. Found this one cheaper.\nTip 1 - Go to this market early morning around 8:45-9 and you will get very good deal as sellers don't want to loose their first lucky customer.\nTip 2 - Ha Tam Jewellery store opposite of gate 5 gives you best usd exchange rate if you have new and crisp notes. Go here also early morning to avoid long queues.\nTip 3 - Buy in multiples like 3 or more pieces so sellers bring down the prices.\nTip 4 - Bargain with patience and smile."

Located in the heart of Ho Chi Minh City, this building stands out for its stunning colonial architecture and timeless charm. The combination of intricate details, high ceilings, and vibrant colors creates a nostalgic atmosphere that transports you to a bygone era.\n\nDuring our visit, we sent five postcards to friends and family, which was such a fun and personal way to connect while traveling. The availability of a wide range of postcards was impressive, and we enjoyed browsing through the beautiful designs. Additionally, the post office has been cleverly developed to include souvenir shops and even options to book tours, making it a versatile stop for tourists.\n\nOne of the highlights was simply taking in the ambiance of the space, where history and functionality meet. However, the only downside was the lack of air conditioning, which made the interior quite hot during our visit. It’s worth preparing for the heat, especially if you plan to spend some time inside browsing or writing postcards.\n\nOverall, the Ho Chi Minh Post Office is a fantastic place to explore, shop, and send unique mementos back home. It’s a memorable experience that combines culture, history, and a personal touch.🔥💪"

Built between 1886 and 1891 during the French colonial period, the building was designed by architect Alfred Foulhoux, though it is often mistakenly attributed to Gustave Eiffel. The post office’s stunning French colonial architecture features grand arches, intricate ironwork, and a beautifully designed interior with a large map of South Vietnam painted on the walls. Despite its historical significance, the post office remains fully operational, serving both locals and tourists. Its charm and historical importance make it a must-visit destination in the city."

This beautifully preserved building combines French colonial architecture with local touches, making it a stunning sight in the heart of the city. From the moment you step inside, you’ll be greeted by the grand interior, featuring high ceilings, ornate details, and large wooden counters.\n\nNot only is it a working post office, but it also serves as a historical site and a popular photo spot. The building houses a few souvenir shops, offering a great opportunity to pick up local goods.\n\nIt’s a fantastic place to stop by if you’re interested in architecture, history, or simply want to see a slice of old-world charm in modern-day Ho Chi Minh City. The staff is friendly, and the atmosphere is welcoming.\n\nDefinitely worth the visit, even if you’re not mailing a letter! The Saigon Central Post Office is free to enter and explore, so there’s no admission fee. However, if you plan to use the post office services, such as mailing items, the fees will depend on the weight, destination, and type of service (standard, express, etc.). Additionally, if you’re purchasing souvenirs or postcards from the small shops inside, those will have their own prices.\n\nIf you’re just visiting to admire the architecture or take photos, you can enjoy the experience at no cost."

The building was built back in the late 1800s during the French colonial era, and you can really see the European influence from the outside—yellow walls, pretty details, and old-school charm 🏛️.\n\nInside, it’s super cool. It kinda reminded me of an old train station with its high ceilings, vintage maps on the wall, and those classic wooden phone booths ✉️. There’s also a big portrait of Ho Chi Minh at the end of the hall that gives it that local touch.\n\nWhen I was there, the place was packed with tourists 🧳. A lot of them were busy choosing postcards, writing sweet messages, and sending them off. It was so nice to see people enjoying something so nostalgic and personal in this digital age ✍️📮. The postcards themselves cost around 20,000 VND, and the postage was about 30,000 VND to Indonesia —pretty affordable for such a memorable experience!\n\nEven though it’s still a working post office, it feels more like a chill, mini museum. It’s quiet (well, except for the buzz of visitors), pretty, and just has this timeless vibe. I loved wandering around, snapping photos, and soaking up the atmosphere 📸. If you’re ever in Ho Chi Minh City, this place is definitely worth a visit!\n\nPS: I sent a postcard to myself from there, and it arrived about a month later. Totally worth the wait—it felt so special to receive something handwritten from a place I visited."

Tickets were bought at the entrance + guardhouse.\n\nArchitecture is stunning and there are countless trinkets showcasing the Vietnamese history and culture etc.\n\nIt seems like it's a popular spot from weddings? When I was there, there was a wedding photoshoot happening at the main stairs hence not a lot of pictures there 😓\n\nNo air conditioning, but the areas were mostly sheltered and cool. There's only 2 floors to the Musuem, but the non-sheltered areas house the tanks & the planes.\n\nFound the Museum to be pretty cool, worth the money and experience. Advice would be to stay there, take your time to leisurely look around the items, it really contains a lot of stuff from the past that's really interesting haha."

Instead, a few couples were there taking wedding photos, adding a charming and romantic atmosphere to my visit.\n\nThough the museum may not have an extensive collection to explore, it is still a wonderful place for anyone interested in exploring both the past and present of this vibrant city.\nIt offers valuable insight into the city's rich history and the lives of the people who have shaped it. It's a place that invites reflection, learning, and a deeper understanding of the city itself.\n\nTickets are quite affordable and easy to purchase on-site, but keep in mind that payment is cash only. There’s also a small surcharge if you bring a camera."

Just don't answer their questions or greeting, otherwise you will end up for unnecessary things. All of us force to buy most expensive coconut here and one of my member's shoes force to wash without asking for permission. Come back for the museum, many things like the helicopter, plane, history, traditional clothes and Vietnam past currency can be see here. May take 1-2 hours to explore, and many people will likely take wedding photo here."

Some rooms have AC, I think that's more to preserve the work than cool the guests.\n\nLots of beautiful young people come here to take photos of themselves, which is in stark contrast to the intent of an art gallery, to appreciate artists and their work. The lighting was a major let down, lots of the spotlights didn't work which meant some of the art had lopsided lighting.\n\nBest part was the lower room of building 2, which seems to entirely house work from the last few years. Interesting that there wasn't any of the vapid youth in this area. Some of the art down there was incredible, at least to my tastes."

A good place for young learners to learn about Vietnamese visual arts mostly. Would recommend to improve the lights of a few galleries as those create high glare on the glasses of the artworks or texts, which makes a bit difficult to understand from a distance. Nonetheless great place and a place I would recommend for the art lovers to visit."

It was used to be one of the most richest guy’s house in Sai Gon back to the past. House with 99 doors. There are 3 floors in total. Each of them show either paintings or art works of numerous Vietnamese artists. Each of the architects very special and beautiful. We went here in the afternoon in weekday so it was not too crowded at all. Beautiful sunshine on the building. The balconies are special and good for taking photos as well. The ticket price is 30.000 (1.2$) per person. I would love to come back here again if I have a chance to visit Ho Chi Minh City\n\nJust wonder about the security issues as there are no cameras and guards, how they gonna protect all the works"

The fabric including the labor to make my ao dai cost just under $35 USD.\n\nI also went upstairs to purchase more clothing and appreciate the vendors for not being too pushy or pressuring me to buy stuff compared to Ben Thanh Market’s vendors so I bought a lot of clothing here. They were nice when bargaining and fair with their prices after we negotiated. I told the vendors I would gladly return to give them my business again. Next time I come, I would like to see the other side of the market and try the food."

If you have time, grab a drink at one of the bars—it’s a little pricey, but the views are totally worth it.\n\nIt’s a great spot to take some photos, chill for a bit, and soak in the city from above. Definitely a highlight of my trip!"

Its picturesque design and soft pink hue make it a popular destination for locals and tourists alike. Unfortunately, during our visit, the church was closed, and we were unable to venture inside. Nevertheless, the exterior was still worth admiring, and we weren't alone – many local and foreign travelers had also gathered to appreciate its beauty.\n\nOne of the best things about visiting this church is that admission is free; you don't need to purchase a ticket to explore the surrounding area. Getting here is also convenient, as you can simply book a Grab ride to arrive at the church's doorstep. Plus, there are plenty of charming coffee shops nearby, offering the perfect spot to relax and take some fancy photos that are sure to impress your Instagram followers."

First of all, the ticket price is ridiculously cheap, 30,000VND (under $1.50US).  Next, the place is much larger than it looks from the outside and filled with interesting and beautiful exhibits. The museum includes exhibits from 1,000 years ago to the Vietnam War, many of them including English explanations. There was a puppet show (extra fee) going on in a small theater in the museum as well as a beautiful garden in the center to sit in the shade and relax. I spent a very enjoyable hour and recommend stopping by."

Unlike the Presidential Palace and the War Museum, this museum is much quieter, and you can very well explore it at your own pace. There are many chambers to see and appreciate about the art and history of this region. Early after is the best time to go as it is quiet, but consider that in most of the chambers, there is no AC, so in hot days, it can be a bit of a challenge."

The place was peaceful and nearly empty, allowing us to explore without any crowds. By the time we left, more visitors had started arriving, so if you prefer a quiet and calm atmosphere, definitely try to go when the doors first open.\nThe museum is beautifully arranged, guiding you step by step through the fascinating history of Vietnam. From ancient civilizations to more recent events, each section flows naturally into the next. We especially enjoyed the displays on ancient wars, traditional weapons, and the evolution of Vietnamese culture. Seeing swords, armor, and other artifacts up close gave us a deeper appreciation of the country’s resilience and rich heritage.\nWhat really stood out was how everything is laid out in a way that’s easy to follow, even if you’re not a history buff. It feels like traveling through time  and learning about Vietnam’s past in one thoughtfully curated package.\n\nThe museum itself is housed in a beautiful colonial era building, and the peaceful garden outside adds to the charm. It’s not a massive museum, but it’s packed with meaningful displays and doesn’t overwhelm you with too much at once.\nOverall, it was a highlight of our trip. Whether you’re just curious about Vietnam’s roots or already passionate about Southeast Asian history, this museum is well worth a visit. Just remember to go early for the best experience!"

Not far from the museum are the famous Jade Emperor Pagoda and a botanical garden, both of which are worth checking out if you're in the area."

In a city where traffic is hectic and streets are perpetually crowded, this park offers an invaluable sense of tranquility. With its sprawling green spaces, towering trees, and shaded pathways, it’s the perfect escape from the urban hustle and bustle.\n\nI spent countless hours here during my stay, relishing the serenity and natural beauty. What struck me most was the predominance of foreign visitors, particularly Europeans, enjoying the calm atmosphere, while many locals seemed to prefer the lively energy of Saigon’s bustling streets.\n\nWhether you’re a jogger, a photography enthusiast, or simply seeking a peaceful retreat, Tao Dan Park is an absolute must-visit. A true urban oasis!"

Another comolete inconvenience was that there was only one allowed access into the park because there were some form of security guards at all other entrances saying we had to walk completely around the park to gain further access."

Lưu Minh, a native of Guangdong, China, was a practitioner of Minh Sư Đạo—a sect that advocated for the restoration of the Ming dynasty and opposed the ruling Qing dynasty. He built the temple both as a place of worship dedicated to the Jade Emperor (Ngọc Hoàng Thượng Đế) and as a clandestine meeting spot to plan efforts to overthrow the Qing dynasty.  ￼\n\nIn 1982, the temple came under the administration of the Vietnamese Buddhist Association when Venerable Thích Vĩnh Khương took over its management. Two years later, in 1984, it was officially renamed Phước Hải Tự, though it continues to be popularly referred to as Chùa Ngọc Hoàng.  ￼\n\nThe pagoda is renowned for its distinctive architectural style, which reflects Chinese influences. It has become a significant spiritual destination for both locals and tourists, who visit to seek blessings related to fertility, love, and overall well-being.  ￼\n\nIn 2016, Chùa Ngọc Hoàng gained international attention when then-U.S. President Barack Obama visited the temple during his official trip to Vietnam, highlighting its cultural and historical importance.\n\nToday, the Jade Emperor Pagoda stands as a testament to the rich cultural tapestry of Ho Chi Minh City, embodying both historical significance and spiritual reverence."

In normal days, it is not difficult to see big busses drop tourists to visit this pagoda. In Lunar New Year, it is super crowded and busy because so many local people come to visit this place. This pagoda is quite small, highly recommend not visit here in the first day of New Year because I think no air to breath and full of smoke from incenses. But they sell something inside the pagoda. In Lunar New Year, they sell both outside too.\n\nThis pagoda looks like Chinese style, they don’t have the place to put small urns of died people and I have never seen any monks here.\n\nBecause this place is small, that’s why they only can offer the place for motorbikes parking, impossible for cars. In Lunar New Year, many places around the pagoda open parking for visitors and the fee is 20,000 VND/ motorbike while no fee if parking in the pagoda.\n\nAlso because this pagoda is small and if you visit here in Lunar New Year you have to be very careful about your belongings to avoid getting pickpocket."

While the building itself is not open to the public, its grandeur and historical significance make it a worthwhile stop on any city tour.\n\nThis French colonial-style structure, built in the early 1900s, showcases intricate detailing and elegant proportions. The bright cream-and-yellow façade, with its arched windows and ornate decorations, is picture-perfect, especially when illuminated at night.\n\nStanding in front of the building, you’ll find a statue of Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam's revered leader, in a peaceful garden setting. The combination of the statue, the manicured greenery, and the building in the background creates a scene that is both picturesque and meaningful.\n\nAlthough you can't go inside, the building is a great spot for photography and a moment of reflection on the city’s history. The surrounding area is also lively, with cafes, restaurants, and shops that make it easy to spend time here."

Quite nice and well reserved given that it is still served as the office building for the current government and administration of the city. Of course this is nothing compared to Versailles and other French world class building and architecture but I’m glad that Saigon manages to keep this building in such good condition."

          "reviewText": "After victories over conquests in Southern Vietnam, in 1870, the French drafted a plan to build an office for municipal council of Saigon at Kinh Lớn (\"Big Canal\"). However, the area was too muddy to lay a foundation hence halting the project. Until 1898, after the canal was covered to be made into Charner Boulevard, the French finally broke ground for the building. 1.5 million francs was approved for the project.The building was a difficult project that took 11 years to finish.\nThe building was opened in 1909 by the French Indochina governors-general to celebrate 50 years of French presense in Saigon. The building was named L'hôtel de ville (\"Municipal Hall\"), while the Vietnamese locals generally called it Dinh xã Tây ('French municipal palace') or Dinh đốc lý or ('mayor's palace').\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the building was used by the city of Saigon government under South Vietnam and was renamed Tòa đô chánh Sài Gòn or Tòa đô sảnh ('Saigon mayor's hall').\nSince the communists’ conquest of Saigon in 1975, the building has housed the Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee and Ho Chi Minh City People's Council. The building was renamed as it is now.\nOn April 29 and 30, 2023, to celebrate the Reunification Day, the building was opened to public for the first time.\n\nDirected by architect Fernand Gardè, the hall design took inspiration from the town hall of Paris and resembles the bell towers of northern France - a rising point-shaped tower accompanied by two adequate symmetrical attic towers and shorter but long blocks on the sides. The center tower includes a clock and at its peak a flag pole. Another storey was then built on top of the blocks in the 1940s.\nThe design of the building is a fusion of multiple classical architectural streams like Renaissance, Baroque and Beaux-Arts, as seen on its with Baroque and Rococo decoration, Art Nouveau iron doors, Corinthian columns and domic entrances. The entire front facade is sculptures of wreaths, ylang ylangs and men in Phrygian cap, reflecting the architecture of the French Third Republic. With so many inspirations taken from, the building was deemed by some as \"a woman with too much jewelry\".\n\nOn the facade of the building, three sculptures of Marianne are placed in the middle of the pediments. She is the national personification of liberty, equality and fraternity of the French Republic.\n\nThe left sculpture shows the figure of Marianne seating on a podium. Her left hand is placed on a vase pouring water while her right hand holds a ship's rudder. She wears a laurel wreath on her head with some laurel decoration on the background. Below the figure is the wheat motif, a Caduceus, and a scythe.\nThe laurel wreath usually implies victory, while the Caduceus is Hermes's staff, often recalled as the symbol of commercial activity or negotiation. The appearance of the ship's rudder is believed to represent the strength of commerce and trading.The sculpture is an indication of equality.\n\nAt the center of the facade, under the bell tower lies a sculpture depicting a goddess and two children and two lions. The child on the left holds a long staff pointing at the female figure, while the boy on the right is stepping between two fierce lions. Marianne is most prominent with her taking-off-Phrygian-clothes posture, similar to the image of half-naked Marianne in the Liberty Leading the People painting. Her position also suggests that they bravely lead each other out of danger and wilderness.\nThe theme of this sculpture could be liberty as the woman is trying to escape from the mess and wild, with her eye looking up, fulfilled with hope and prospect. Out of the three sculptures, this one is also the most active form of Marianne, as she does not rest but moves vividly. This central sculpture stands for fraternity."

Picture this: it’s the early 20th century, and the French colonial rulers, with their flair for grandeur, erect the Hôtel de Ville de Saigon. Fast forward to the tumultuous '60s, this elegant edifice, with its intricate façade and majestic clock tower, becomes the backdrop for one of the most dramatic moments in Vietnam’s history.\n\nIn '63, right in front of this iconic building, a group of Buddhist monks staged a protest that shook the very core of the nation. Their peaceful demonstration against the government’s oppressive policies drew international attention, casting a spotlight on the plight of the Vietnamese people. This wasn’t just a protest; it was a catalyst for change, a moment that would echo through the annals of history.\n\nToday, this building stands not only as a testament to French architectural prowess but also as a silent witness to the resilience & enduring spirit of the Vietnamese people.\n\nIt’s a place where the past and present collide, offering a profound reminder of the city’s rich, albeit tumultuous, heritage.\n\nQuite the tale, wouldn’t you agree?"

The aircon was fine here. Food/drinks were not recommended to consume if you’ll bring one. Mostly are foreigners though the language used was in Vietnamese. No need to learn the Vietnamese because mostly are in actions and sounds. Light and choreography of the puppets were excellent. Worth your money. We bought our ticket online and claimed the physical ticket thru one of the staff in front of the kiosk. Souvenirs were sold outside after the show and it was not that expensive especially the toys and post cards. Definitely all souvenirs were unique and you can buy it only at that place."

As you stroll along, you might be surprised by the warm hospitality of locals, with some even offering you a complimentary drink or inviting you to take a seat. The street is abuzz with activity, featuring “sexy men and women dancers” that add to the lively ambiance, often accompanied by loud music that pulsates through the air. The nightlife here is truly unique, giving the impression that sleep is a distant concept in this area. It's an exhilarating experience that's definitely worth anticipating – the energy is electric, and the memories are waiting to be made."

The music from the DJ is just right lively enough to set the mood, but not too loud like in a nightclub. You can still have conversations while enjoying the breeze with friends out on the sidewalk.\n\nI really enjoyed sipping on a drink, snacking on tasty street-style food, and watching the busy street life go by full of good vibes and eye catching people passing through!\n\nThe prices are affordable, and the whole atmosphere feels relaxed and friendly.\nIt was definitely a fun and refreshing experience for me .

The crowd on the street transforms, and you can see the  people starting to wear off the serious business-like and busy-looking faces to be replaced by a more casual, relaxed, calm and easy-going manner.\n\nAs the night progresses, the entire street is transformed into one huge party zone with the many clubs and bars coming alive, the sights of the alluring beautiful techno lights livening up the night with rainbow colours glittering and inviting everyone from party-goers and lonely souls to partake in a night of fun and revelry.\n\nIn my opinion, there is no other street in HCM City that can rival Bui Vien Walking Street at night in terms of party atmosphere and vibes. It is such a captivating, lively and enjoyable yet relaxing atmosphere.\n\nI spent most of my 2 nights of my stay in HCM City in Bui Vien Walking Street enjoying my dinner with a glass of flavourful and rich iced Vietnamese black coffee at my favourite joint, 5 Boys, while watching the world go by.\n\nAlthough I stayed at a hotel very close by to Bui Vien Walking Street, I do not feel disturbed or annoyed by the blaring heart-pounding music from the many clubs there nor did it cause me any sleepless nights.\n\nI very strongly recommend tourists / visitors to HCM City to pay a visit to Bui Vien Street during the night at least once during your visit to this beautiful city.\n\nTo me, Bui Vien Walking Street did not disappoint, and I really enjoyed my time there having dinner while sipping the flavourful and rich iced Vietnamese black coffee."

It’s busy and vibrant, but also feels quite safe with lots of people around.\n\nPerfect for people who love nightlife, trying local snacks, and meeting new friends.

It’s a nice spot to spend a few hours, especially if you enjoy being outdoors. They also have some interactive activities, like feeding the animals, which kids would really enjoy.\n\nThat being said, the zoo doesn’t have many rare or exotic animals—mostly common ones like elephants, deer, monkeys, tigers, and lions. But I understand that maintaining a zoo requires a lot of funding, so it’s not always easy to bring in more unique species. The animals seem to be taken care of fairly well, but some enclosures weren’t very clean and had a bit of a smell. It would be great if they could improve that part.\n\nOverall, if you’re looking for a casual place to walk around and see some animals, this is a good option, especially for families with kids. Hopefully, with more support and investment, the zoo can continue to improve and create an even better experience for visitors!"

A lot of the animals looked very well cared for and very well but there were a few pacers.  We went on the big wheel here that was magnificent - a real treat and cost about 30,000 each.

The park feels a bit worn down, with some areas showing their age — faded paint, cracked paths, and benches that look like they survived a few storms too many. It’s not the fanciest zoo you’ll ever visit, but it has a certain raw charm that’s kinda nostalgic.\n\nWhat really sets it apart, though, is the animal variety. Compared to the glammed-up amusement parks like Nha Trang’s VinWonders, Saigon Zoo has a surprisingly large number of animals packed into its space — from monkeys jumping around to peacocks strutting their stuff, and plenty of other critters. It’s like a little jungle right in the middle of the city.\n\nThe place is pretty clean considering its age, and the crowd is usually chill — mostly locals and a few curious travelers. There’s even a modest public restroom if you need it, though don’t expect anything fancy.\n\nBest of all? The entrance fee is dirt cheap — just 2 bucks. For that price, you get a chance to see a lot of different animals and soak in a bit of old-school Saigon vibes. So if you’re up for a laid-back afternoon surrounded by animals, without the glitz and glam, this is your spot."

The attention to detail in its lighting and decorations makes it a visually stunning destination after dark.\n\nInside the park, many carnival-style games and attractions are still active, with new activities and entertainment options added over time. These updates keep the experience fresh for returning visitors. However, despite these improvements, the promotional efforts and media outreach to attract more tourists have not been fully developed. While the park has great potential, stronger marketing strategies could help bring in even more visitors and boost its appeal to a wider audience."

It's like a Disneyland partitioned out to many lots and outsourced to different vendors.\n\nBut that's part of the charm that makes such parks in Vietnam interesting. They may seem tacky at first glance but it is a smorgasbord on the rich cultural influences that have shaped Vietnam, many of which not by their own choosing but willing to embrace.\n\nEnjoy the sceneries of the different sections, don't have to buy the package tickets, u can choose to buy inside if something catches your fancy. Many of the other ticketed attractions are a little dated and run dwn. The water theme park though catered for families and kids, is enjoyable and pleasant to have at the end of the visit"

I foresee the end of this park soon in 2025 or 2026 if there is no new vision + new investment, I believe they need help.\n\nI cannot believe their paper map is so messy and unprofessional ... even fresher could you much better.\n\nGood point, the park seems better maintained than most other places in vietnam.\n\nI sincerely hope they will find a way to improve cause there is no much attractions in hcmc."

What I personally don’t like is that you have to pay for keeping your stuff each time you need your bags. It’s just 25,000 but anyway this is the first time I’ve experienced such a strange rule in the water park.👎🏽there is a food court, so if you’re hungry don’t worry you can find smth to eat and it’s cheap. In general, it’s ok just be careful on the slides, have fun and enjoy your time in Dam Sen Water Park🛝🌊"

However, there were some concerns, particularly regarding the counter at the entrance, which marred an otherwise fantastic day.\n\n**Cleanliness and Professionalism:** The water park boasts a commendable level of cleanliness and maintenance. The staff members are highly professional, courteous, and attentive, ensuring a pleasant and safe environment for all visitors. The rides are well-maintained, and the water quality is pristine, contributing to an enjoyable experience.\n\n**Value and Attractions:** The variety of rides offered at Dam Sen Water Park is commendable, providing a good mix of thrills and relaxation. The presence of adequate safety guards ensures a sense of security, allowing visitors to enjoy the attractions with peace of mind. While it might not be the largest water park, it offers a welcomed escape from the hustle and bustle of Ho Chi Minh City.\n\n**Concerns at the Entrance Counter:** However, a major downside surfaced at the entrance counter, where phone covers and floats are sold. The exorbitant pricing of $20 for a phone cover, coupled with the staff's attempt to push unnecessary purchases by stating that each cover accommodates only one phone, appears exploitative, especially towards foreigners. This practice of trying to extract more money from visitors by enforcing unnecessary purchases significantly detracted from an otherwise enjoyable experience.\n\n**Final Thoughts:** Despite the regrettable encounter at the entrance counter, Dam Sen Water Park remains a decent option for a day of relaxation and fun in Ho Chi Minh City. The park's cleanliness, well-maintained rides, and attentive staff contribute to an overall positive experience. However, potential visitors should be cautious and aware of possible tactics aimed at extracting additional money.\n\nIn summary, Dam Sen Water Park offers an enjoyable getaway from the city's hustle and bustle, featuring well-maintained rides and a clean environment. Nonetheless, the exploitative practices at the entrance counter regarding the sale of phone covers and floats merit attention and consideration before planning a visit."

Pretty interesting history of Tamil traders that came into the country in the early 19th century. I believe most of them have left and the temple is run by a local trustee. It’s a mix of Hindu and Buddhist deities and way of praying. I’m amazed that many locals come here to pray too. It’s a beautiful vibe. Sit down for a few minutes and soak in the architectural beauty of the temple, the blend of culture and religion, read the history of the temple (Which I think could be improved) and just pray in which ever practise you follow."

          "reviewText": "The Mariamman Temple in Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City) offers a serene and sacred escape amidst the city's lively hustle and bustle. Nestled in the heart of District 1, this Hindu temple is dedicated to Mariamman, the goddess of rain and disease, and serves as a spiritual hub for both locals and visitors.\n\nThe temple’s vibrant and intricate architecture stands out with its colorful statues, detailed carvings, and ornate decorations. Upon entering, you’re greeted by the scent of incense and the sound of soft chants, which help create a peaceful ambiance that contrasts sharply with the surrounding urban activity. The temple's peaceful atmosphere invites you to pause and reflect, offering a sense of tranquility that feels almost otherworldly amid Saigon’s fast-paced energy.\n\nDespite its relatively small size, the temple is a vital part of the local Hindu community, and visitors often come to pay their respects, pray for blessings, or seek protection from ailments. The temple also serves as a cultural touchstone for the Indian diaspora in Vietnam, preserving ancient rituals and traditions that have been passed down for generations.\n\nWhat makes the Mariamman Temple especially unique is its location in one of the most dynamic areas of the city. Walking through the busy streets, where street vendors and motorcycles bustle by, then stepping into the quiet sanctuary of the temple creates a striking contrast and a reminder of the city’s rich cultural and spiritual diversity.\n\nOverall, the Mariamman Temple is an exceptional spot for those interested in exploring the spiritual side of Saigon. Its divine presence amidst the chaos offers a unique experience of serenity and reflection, making it a hidden gem for both spiritual seekers and curious travelers alike."

          "reviewText": "Nestled in the vibrant heart of Ho Chi Minh City, the Mariamman Hindu Temple, fondly known as Chùa Bà Ấn Độ, stands as a captivating testament to cultural fusion at 45 Trương Định Street, District 1. Built in the early 20th century by Tamil merchants from South India, this sacred site began as a humble shrine to serve the spiritual needs of Indian immigrants in Saigon. Over time, it evolved into a magnificent structure, reconstructed between 1950-1952, showcasing intricate Hindu architecture with its iconic U-shaped layout, vibrant gopuram tower, and 18 divine statues symbolizing human aspirations. Dedicated to Goddess Mariamman, revered for blessings of prosperity, health, and fertility, the temple radiates spiritual allure.\nThe temple’s history intertwines with Saigon’s growth, reflecting the significant contributions of the Indian community. These merchants, primarily Chettiyars, enriched Saigon’s economy through trade and commerce, fostering cultural exchange that shaped the city’s diverse identity. The temple became a beacon of unity, welcoming not only Hindus but also Vietnamese and Chinese worshippers, blending Hindu rituals with local Buddhist practices. Daily fire ceremonies at 10 AM and 7 PM draw devotees seeking divine blessings, while its proximity to landmarks like Bến Thành Market enhances its role as a cultural hub.\nMariamman Temple is more than a place of worship; it’s a living legacy of India’s enduring influence on Saigon’s multicultural tapestry. Visiting this sacred space, with its serene ambiance and architectural splendor, inspires awe and appreciation for the harmonious blend of cultures that continues to define Ho Chi Minh City."

          "reviewText": "Picture this: a late 19th-century temple built by Tamil traders, dedicated to the goddess Mariamman, who, let’s be honest, sounds like the superhero of deities—curing diseases & bringing rain. Move over, Marvel.\n\nArchitecturally, this place is like a colorful explosion of South Indian style. The gopuram (that’s fancy talk for the tower at the entrance) is adorned with enough statues and carvings to keep you staring in awe for days. And don’t even get me started on the inside—statues of Ganesha, Vishnu, and of course, Mariamman herself. It’s like a who’s who of the Hindu pantheon.\n\nHere’s the kicker: this temple isn’t just for Hindus. You’ve got Buddhists, local Vietnamese, and more than a couple of confused tourists all flocking here to pray for health, prosperity, and protection from evil spirits. It’s a melting pot of faith, wrapped up in a vibrant, cultural hug.\n\nSo, if you find yourself in Saigon, do yourself a favor and swing by this temple. It’s a historical gem, a cultural blend, and a place where the past and present collide in the most colorful way possible. Plus, where else can you get a spiritual boost and a history lesson all in one go?"

How  horrendously disrespectful. I am truly ashamed to have to witnessed such horrific and outrageous behavior. What a massive display of disrespect to the physicians and doctors that were supposed to be honored here, what a massive disrespect to the hundreds of years of revolutionary knowledge. What a disrespect to the gift of medicine and healing as a whole, and the man who donated and started this museum- and to the original founders of Vietnamese medicine. This place is supposed to be a symbol of honor for our culture, a place of beauty, aw, and reverence.\n\nIt just shows the insensitivity of people these days. Posing about with no clue of where they are at, what they’re posing with, and no social awareness or respect for those trying to view the actual museum. Or kindness to move out of the way. Majority of the people here were just massive groups of youth posing - and staff didn’t seem to try and manage any of it( which I hope they do)\n\nI did end up buying some medicine, enjoying the short film and architecture and free tea\n\nI hope the staff implements rules.\nNot sure if id come again. Even though I loved what this place was initially intended for.\n\nReally shows the degradation of our society and culture today."

It’s like someone thought, “Hey, let’s put a giant turtle in the middle of a lake and see what happens!” And it worked brilliantly.\n\nBy day, it’s a peaceful spot where you can catch your breath. By night, it turns into a street food haven, with vendors serving up everything from fried squid to corn on the cob.\n\nWhether you’re there for the oddball charm or just to grab a bite and chill, this place has got you covered. It’s a bit of quirky bliss in the middle of Saigon!"

If you walk anywhere with some, they’re going to snatch it. Rumor has it that ice cream can be traded to get back your sunglasses (which they love), hats (which they love), phones (which they love), or any other physical object (which YOU love). Leave as much as you can in the car, bus, or people movers. Rangers can often get stuff back for you, but sometimes they’re just not there when it happens.\n\nSome tour guides liked to carry sticks to fend off the monkeys, but aided by our tour guide, we were wisely told that if a monkey does approach you or jump on you, try not to freak out. They are most interested in what they can steal off of you (don’t have it on you in the first place) and they just want to smell you and see what you’re all about."

A lot of people come here to rent an Ao Dai and take photos in different areas. There is only one building where you can really see the history of the Ao Dai, most structures are made for photoshoot. Walking around is also a bit of a hassle as everywhere you go people are posing and taking photos.\n\nI'd recommend bringin a fan as the museum has no AC and it becomes really warm inside."

Unlike the overcrowded attractions in Ho Chi Minh City, this museum remains largely undiscovered, with weekdays often so quiet that visitors may have the grounds entirely to themselves—a luxury that surely won’t last as word spreads.\n\nThe collection of áo dài is impressive, showcasing everything from historical designs to modern interpretations, each reflecting Vietnam’s rich cultural heritage. Most signs are in both Vietnamese and English, guiding visitors through the evolution of this iconic garment. The museum’s architecture, with its wooden corridors and open spaces, blends seamlessly with the lush, well-maintained landscape. The tranquil pond, complete with lotus flowers and fish from the very grounds, adds to the authenticity and charm of the setting.\n\nFor those seeking a cultural experience away from the crowds, this is an exceptional destination. The combination of history, fashion, and stunning scenery makes it a must-visit before it inevitably gains the attention it deserves."

On the ground floor, there is a park with a great atmosphere. At night, the wind blows very cool, suitable for chilling out with friends and talking. I walked around and found a shopping mall near the condo where I was staying. The view is very beautiful. From my room, I could see the lake. The staff provided excellent service. However, it was quite difficult to contact the owner of the room I rented. I arrived at the airport and when I was about to arrive at the accommodation, he still hadn't called to ask where I was going to leave my stuff or what time I could check in. Plus, the cleaning was slow and difficult to contact. He said that check-in was at 2 pm. I went for a walk until 2:30 pm and he still hadn't contacted me back. Plus, during the four days I stayed, there was no cleaning at all. The soaps in the bathroom were not refilled for new guests, and the packaging was broken. It was very bad."

We had a problem with the air conditioning and it took 3 hours to fix. 5 people were in the room so we could not relax and pack our bags. Also, they lost some of our laundry. Took away the most important thing in a family, time. We had to waste more than five hours on all this crap. on the first day, they told us the hotel is about 60% full when we have this issue with the air conditioning, we asked if we could just move to another connecting room because I was with my parents, they said they have none left. What type of five star hotel treats 2  ambassadors (my parents) like that?"

I went late morning on a weekday and there was no line. I was on the hi-speed elevator in less than 1 minute for a quick ride to the observation deck which is just below the platform of the building. It was only a bit hazy on a Feb day and the view was excellent. There were only a few dozen people which was nice. Besides the view, there is a tiny museum of traditional woman's clothing and a few beautiful tiny bamboo buildings. There's also a gift shop where you can get a free bottle of water (warm) and buy some overpriced souvenirs. I got some good pix and was ready to go after 20 minutes or so."

The staff were kind and welcoming, and we also received complimentary water with our tickets.\n\nI loved the cultural displays—there was an engaging section about the traditional Vietnamese dress the ao dai and how it has evolved over time. Another highlight was the interactive bamboo structure—visitors could add their own small bamboo sticks to a growing installation, which was such a creative and meaningful experience to be a part of.\n\nOverall, it was a great mix of breathtaking views and rich cultural insight. Highly recommend!"

The entire city lit up beneath you, and the binoculars let you zoom in on Saigon’s wild traffic from above. It’s mesmerizing.\n\nThe mini gallery of traditional Vietnamese costumes was a nice cultural touch that gave the experience more depth. A perfect blend of modern cityscape and local heritage.\n\nThis is a must. Great way to take in the city from a whole new angle."

Many shops also offer stationery, postcards, and souvenirs, giving it a charming blend of local culture and creativity.\n\nThere are several shaded benches and casual cafés where you can sip on a Vietnamese coffee or tea while diving into your latest read. The atmosphere is relaxed and welcoming, and you could easily spend an hour or two browsing, sitting back, or people-watching.\n\nArt installations and sculptures add to the charm, and the entire space feels thoughtfully curated and community-focused. It’s clean, pedestrian-only, and a great place to slow down.\n\nI highly recommend it for solo travelers, couples, or anyone looking for a break in a calm and creative setting. A refreshing change of pace right in the middle of District 1."

Book Street is located right next to the Saigon Central Post Office and the Notre-Dame Cathedral, so it’s super easy to find if you’re visiting those landmarks.\n\nI came on a weekday early in the morning, and it was so peaceful—not crowded at all, which made it even more enjoyable. You can just stroll, take your time, and explore the cozy bookshops, little cafés, and seating areas.\n\nDefinitely worth a visit if you’re a book lover or just looking for a quiet spot in the city!"

The architecture? Stunning. The carvings? Intricate and beautiful. And the people? Full of devotion, lighting incense and making offerings with a kind of grace and sincerity that’s both humbling & uplifting.\n\nSo, if you're in Ho Chi Minh City, whether you're a believer or not, this pagoda is worth a visit.

It's like if a kung fu movie set and a desert oasis had a baby, and that baby grew up to be a cultural gem in the heart of Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nThe first thing that strikes you is the blend of styles: intricate Chinese woodwork meets Islamic calligraphy, with a splash of green that feels refreshingly cool amidst the hustle and bustle of the city. It's a peaceful retreat where you can hear yourself think—if you're not too busy admiring the beautiful pond and lush courtyard.\n\nWhether you're a history buff, a culture vulture, or just someone looking for a quiet place to escape the city noise, this temple is a must-visit. It’s not just a religious site; it's a testament to the diverse tapestry that makes up Saigon.\n\nSo, if you're in town, pop in and soak up some tranquility and history. You might just find yourself feeling a bit more Zen!"
