The staff was extremely accommodating and made sure our 2 reserved rooms were connecting as we have smaller children. This was very helpful so we did not have to split up and our stay could be very comfortable.\nThe hotel and grounds were very clean and well taken care of. The pool area was especially very relaxing in the afternoons after exploring the city in the morning. All of the staff were very kind and helpful, and the concierge gave excellent recommendations to us for a tailor and dinner options. The breakfast was outstanding with a ton of variety and everything was very fresh and delicious. Finally, the hotel was in my opinion, in the best spot in Saigon District 1, right next to the opera house and walking distance to many great restaurants, coffee shops, and markets. I would highly recommend staying here!"

From the moment I arrived, every interaction was marked by genuine attentiveness and professionalism. They went above and beyond to ensure a seamless stay, and their recognition of my Hyatt Globalist status was both thoughtful and appreciated. From an upgraded room to personalized service throughout, I felt genuinely valued as a guest.\n\nOne of the loveliest touches was the welcome gift waiting in my room—a beautiful gesture that set the tone for the entire visit. The room itself was elegant and impeccably maintained, with refined details that reflect the property’s French colonial charm.\n\nBreakfast was a highlight each morning: beautifully presented, with a wide range of high-quality options, both Western and local. The setting was relaxed and stylish, and the staff were attentive without being intrusive.\n\nThe afternoon tea service is also not to be missed—an elevated experience with delicate pastries, teas, and savories, served in a serene lounge that feels worlds away from the bustle outside. And come evening, the bar was lively and inviting, with a solid cocktail menu and great energy. It’s the kind of place you want to linger in, whether you're unwinding solo or catching up with friends.\n\nPark Hyatt Saigon sets the standard for hospitality in Ho Chi Minh City. Every detail feels intentional, every experience curated. I’ll absolutely return."

A mindful architecture reminiscent of the past French Colonial influence combined with the ease of modern comforts. The well-earned five-star rating is clearly reflected in the service. Every staff member shows the same cohesive attention to detail. The Opera Breakfast Buffet is the perfect start to the day with a wide array of choices. Most of the items are staples but other delicious dishes, including local favorites, are rotated through. The city view is wonderful and not noisy. Housekeeping was perfect every single day for a one week stay. Xuan Spa is a marvelous retreat for tired muscles. Room service options are very limited late night. Pool area adequate and tidy. Take a mental note of the artwork throughout the guest area; they are a meaningful reflection of the Vietnamese culture and are exquisite. The location is very convenient to local sights; the famed Opera House is a neighbor. Do not hesitate to arrange the Luxury Car Service and Fast Track through the hotel. The journey to/from Tan Son Nhat is made much less stressful when there is a local airport service to help guide through the tedious process and the result is long lines and uncertainty are gone. A world class property for any length of stay in a highly desirable destination."

The moment the concierge opened the doors for us at the Park Hyatt, we felt an overwhelming sense of relief and calm. It was like stepping into a sanctuary. The warm welcome and seamless check-in instantly set the tone for the rest of our stay.\n\nThe room was immaculate and so thoughtfully designed. The bed was absolutely massive—it comfortably fit all four of us with plenty of room to spare! After the chaos of travel, it was exactly what we needed to reset.\n\nThe following morning, we ordered breakfast to our room and it was like a royal banquet—truly incredible. The quality, presentation, and variety were next level, and it made for such a special start to our day.\n\nFrom the beautiful surroundings to the impeccable service, everything about our stay was top-notch. Even with two energetic toddlers, we always felt welcomed and cared for. We can’t thank the team at Park Hyatt Saigon enough for making our family trip so memorable. We’ll definitely be back!"

The brunch here is, without a doubt, the best I’ve ever experienced. The hotel itself is stunning, with its elegant architecture that beautifully reflects the charm of old Saigon. Every detail, from the luxurious ambiance to the impeccable service, makes it a standout destination.\n\nHowever, as a frequent guest, I believe the cleanliness of the restrooms near to the brunch area should match the hotel’s high standards.. . During a recent visit, I had to request toilet cleaning four times within three hours. Since restrooms are the \"facade\" of any hotel, maintaining their condition is crucial for guest satisfaction.\n\nThat said, the Park Hyatt Saigon remains one of my favorite places. I’ll always return for the incredible brunch and the timeless elegance it offers. With just a little extra attention to upkeep, it could be absolutely flawless."

And the breakfast was delicious with a buffet and an à la carte menu with plenty of choices. It was our anniversary, they left us chocolates wine and Rose petal filled bath.\nI highly recommend this Hotel while in Hoi chi min City."

The combination of high moisture and poor ventilation has left a musty smell of mildew and mold in the room. This was inappropriate for my 3 night stay there.  I spoke to someone at the front desk and a dehumidifier was provided to mitigate the bad smell but the persisting odor lingered.  This is definitely a sure sign of much needed maintenance.  I suggest the hotel look into this issue or this problem will only get worse. Overall 4 stars."

The view is great and location is as central as it can get. Food is very average at the French restaurant. The long bar doesn’t have air conditioning which can make it quite unpleasant if you go there during the summer like we did. The rooms had a musty smell which was very unpleasant. Also the decor in the room is quite jarring but this is something I should have paid more attention to before booking."

From the moment I arrived, I was greeted with warm hospitality and a level of service that truly stood out. The staff were so kind and attentive, making sure everything was perfect from check-in to check-out.\n\nMy Deluxe Twin room was absolutely stunning—beautiful decor, a super comfortable bed, and an incredible view of the city. It felt like a little slice of luxury right in the heart of Ho Chi Minh City. Every small detail, from the high-end amenities to the thoughtful touches in the room, made my stay extra special.\n\nBooking through Agoda was smooth, it was well worth the experience. Even though I was only there for a short time, it left such a lasting impression. If you're looking for a place that combines elegance, comfort, and outstanding service, this is the one!\n\n📅 Stayed on: February 11, 2025\n📍 Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam\n\nCan’t wait to come back again someday! 💙"

Even took our number to assist us in what we were looking for in the area. The concierge booked us a driver for the next day. Their taxi services are very reliable and trustworthy. The restaurant even gave me a cake for my birthday. They have a Michelen rated restaurant in the hotel. They meet and greet you by your name.

          "reviewText": "A True Gem in the Heart of Saigon – The Reverie Deserves Its “Six-Star” Reputation\n\nDuring our one-month trip in Saigon, we stayed in several five-star hotels across District 1, each offering their own version of luxury. But The Reverie Saigon truly holds a special place in our hearts. We were exploring different locations and came across this hotel through glowing online reviews calling it a “six-star” property, and we must say, it exceeded our expectations in almost every way.\n\nFrom the moment we stepped into the grand lobby to our private check-in on the 38th floor, the hospitality was world-class. Every staff member was incredibly polite, attentive, and genuinely caring. We stayed in one of their spacious suites, which came with access to the executive lounge on the 38th floor, a quiet, refined space perfect for relaxing, working, or enjoying a meal in peace.\n\nOne of the highlights was the view from our suite, directly overlooking the bustling city and a stretch of the river. The complimentary minibar, the walk-in closets, the spacious living room, and even the pillow menu made our stay extremely comfortable, thoughtful touches that go beyond the standard five-star experience.\n\nWe were fortunate enough to witness part of Vietnam’s 50th reunification celebration from above (including part of the drone show and the fireworks) thanks to the hotel’s prime location. However, during this period, the lounge became a bit too crowded, with many local guests from the north. Unfortunately, this led to a less luxurious experience: noise, children running around, and guests not respecting the dress code. It briefly affected the overall ambiance of the lounge, which is normally very serene and exclusive.\n\nDespite that, the hotel handled every concern with grace. We had an issue with the room temperature on our first night, and staff addressed it immediately. The next day, we were upgraded to an executive suite, yet another example of their commitment to guest satisfaction.\n\nThe service details were impeccable: nightly turndown service with chocolates, afternoon English high tea, cocktail hour, and a combination of buffet and à la carte breakfast, all included with lounge access. One small thing that amazed us was how housekeeping neatly rolled and tied every single charger cable and hair tools we had scattered around the room. This a level of detail we’ve never experienced elsewhere.\n\nA very special mention to the executive lounge team, especially Viet Anh, the lounge manager, who made us feel so welcome and at home. His team, young, professional, and full of warmth, made every interaction feel personal. We’re incredibly grateful to have met Huy, Nhi, Minh Anh, Quang Anh, Giang, Binh (and more), all of whom provided exceptional service and made our time in the lounge truly memorable.\n\nEven on the day we returned for a second stay at the end of our trip, Viet Anh wasn’t working, but had made arrangements to ensure we received the warmest welcome from the moment we stepped out of our taxi, what a gesture! We’d also like to thank Lam, the friendly and professional bellboy who welcomed us on our first day, and Thê Anh from room service, who ensured every in-room request was handled with efficiency and care.\n\nWe remember each of these names fondly, as they all played a part in making The Reverie not just a hotel, but an experience we will never forget.\n\nWe’re already dreaming of returning.\n\nMai & Ngoc"

But it's not so much its opulent design, it's the service that makes Reverie Saigon the 'best'. They truly do everything to make you feel welcome, and room service is PERFECT (they even fold your charger cables.. and your clothes). They are always there for you, but they aren't \"hovering\" either.\n\nOf course the place looks like Michael Jackson's home, and some might love it, while others find it kitsch. But at least, it's got personality - when every other luxury 5* hotel in the world look identical to each other these days.\n\nFor me, it was a 5 days stay where I needed to be at peace, not a touristy thing. And it delivered on this \"weird\" request. At something like 200 quid a night it's not cheap by Vietnames standards but it's very affordable compared to other so called 6 stars properties around the world. It's also centrally located to everything I wanted access to, and the concierge was able to book private tours for me. Amazing.\n\nRun to this hotel if you are in Vietnam and want a special experience!"

You’re steps away from iconic landmarks, shopping, and dining, making it an ideal base for exploring.\n\nServices: 10/10The service is nothing short of impeccable. The staff’s attentiveness is unparalleled, with thoughtful touches like twice-daily room make-up, daily refills of the complimentary minibar, and an ice bucket ready upon check-in. Every detail is meticulously handled, creating a seamless and pampered stay.\n\nRoom (Corner Grand Deluxe Twin): 10/10The corner Grand Deluxe Twin room offers breathtaking views, arguably the best in Ho Chi Minh City. Floor-to-ceiling windows showcase the city’s skyline, making it a highlight of the stay. The room itself is spacious, comfortable, and well-appointed.\n\nAmenities: 10/10The hotel’s amenities are top-tier, from the stunning pool and spa to the diverse dining options. Everything is designed to cater to guests’ needs, ensuring a luxurious and convenient experience.\n\nDesign: 8/10While the hotel’s opulent design exudes grandeur, it may not appeal to everyone. The lavish, ornate style feels a bit heavy for those who prefer modern minimalism. Additionally, some equipment shows signs of age, which slightly detracts from the otherwise flawless experience.\n\nOverall The Reverie Saigon is a near-perfect luxury hotel, blending prime location, exceptional service, and stunning views with world-class amenities. While the extravagant design and slightly dated equipment might not suit all tastes, it remains a top choice for an unforgettable stay in Ho Chi Minh City. Highly recommended for those seeking indulgence and convenience."

From the moment we arrived—greeted at 3am with a warm welcome from the doorman and a lovely concierge—we knew we were in for something special.\n\nThe following morning, we experienced the à la carte breakfast for the first time, and it truly exceeded expectations. Every inch of the hotel feels new, luxurious, and thoughtfully designed. It has that polished, high-end feel without being over the top.\n\nWhat really sets the M Gallery apart, though, is the incredible staff. Special shoutouts to:\n•\tTinh, the exceptional Food & Beverage Manager,\n•\tWang, the attentive waiter at the Level 2 buffet,\n•\tJoey, our friendly server at Albion on Level 23, and\n•\tTram, another amazing Food & Beverage Manager at breakfast.\n\nEach of them made us feel genuinely welcome and valued. A particularly touching moment was when Tinh went out of his way to personally thank me for the feedback I’d shared with the hotel manager—he even stayed back after his shift to do so. That level of care and gratitude is rare and truly appreciated.\n\nThe rooftop pool on Level 24 with its 180-degree city views is breathtaking, and Albion’s chic setting makes for the perfect spot to unwind. We’ve stayed at many Accor properties over the years, and while service is typically outstanding, the M Gallery in District 1 is truly in a league of its own.\n\nIf you’re visiting District 1 and want a stylish, spotless, and centrally located hotel with the warmest staff you’ll ever meet—book the M Gallery now. You won’t regret it."

The first issue is that the check in process involves sitting down with the concierge while they sit down. This means in the future, one never feels comfortable about approaching them to ask for anything. I found the staff never made any spontaneous effort, in contrast to all of the cheaper hotels in Vietnam where I stayed. The rooms were beautifully clean and reasonably spacious but we had a disappointing view and no balcony. The location is sensational but there are many other hotels in the same area which are much better value. They do have a beautiful rooftop pool."

The room was immaculately clean, beautifully styled, and filled with thoughtful amenities that added to the classy ambiance.\n\nThe Executive Lounge team was incredibly attentive—special thanks to Miss Huyen and Uyen for going above and beyond to make my stay memorable. Concierge Bao was fantastic and secured last-minute reservations for me at top-tier Michelin-starred restaurants in HCMC—absolutely brilliant service!\n\nBreakfast was another highlight, offering a wide variety of local and international options with incredibly friendly staff making each morning a great start. The rooftop bar is a must-visit for a drink with a view, and the hidden gem on the 23rd floor—a British fusion restaurant—served exceptional cuisine worthy of Michelin Guide attention.\n\nI highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Saigon, whether for business or pleasure. I’ll definitely be returning!"

The room was spotless, the rooftop bar/pool was great, and the breakfast buffet spread was pretty decent as well.  Pretty sure we tried 75% of the cocktails from the rooftop bar and they were all tasty 😂👍🏼\n\nI find it a little strange that the room and bathroom is divided by a curtain but I think it's not bad if there's a bathtub in your room. The bed was probably the best part. Super soft and comfortable. Every night was a good sleep.\n\nThe location is perfect as well. Very central and close to a lot of restaurants and cafes. There was alot going on in the area during our stay so there was always traffic going to and from the hotel.\n\nI will definitely stay here again next time I need a staycation in Vietnam."

They did send us to a currency exchange place about 20 mins walk away but sadly they wouldn’t change them either.\n\nThe room was spacious and full of everything you’d expect from a 5* hotel in terms of water, toiletries, slippers etc…\n\nBreakfast was vast and amazing. No end to local cuisine, juices, fruits, breads, eggs - you name it and it was there.\n\nExtending our check out by 1 hour was no problem either and it helped allow enough time to do some local in the morning before transferring to another hotel.\n\nWe had dinner on the 23rd floor at the Michelin star Albion restaurant with amazing views. The tasting menu was exceptional and the staff, in particular Joey, were wonderful."

Breakfast is a highlight!\n\nStaff are all very warm and helpful. A special shout out to Long who looked after us and my family when came later to meet with us.\n\nWe are looking forward to another two nights on our way back through before travelling home to Melbourne."

This hidden perch serves cocktails with views so dazzling, you’ll forget Saigon’s chaos below.

The variety of dishes was impressive, and each one was carefully prepared, delicious, and of excellent quality. Everything was beautifully presented, making the experience even more enjoyable from the very first glance.\n\nBut what truly impressed me wasn’t just the great food—it was the outstanding service. The staff here are exceptional; they pay attention to every little detail, always ready to assist, and make guests feel genuinely welcome. I especially want to compliment That, Lan, and Thy. They were not only quick and attentive but also highly professional and incredibly friendly. Their dedication made my breakfast not just delicious but also a truly enjoyable experience.\n\nIf I have the chance to return, I will definitely not miss breakfast here. A fantastic experience that I highly recommend to anyone looking for perfection in both cuisine and service!"

The staff were incredibly warm and welcoming, taking the time to explain all the available facilities and even suggesting some great local restaurants to try.\n\nA special shout-out to Fox at the door, who greeted us every day with the brightest smile – such a lovely touch that made us feel right at home.\n\nBreakfast was absolutely incredible, with a wide variety of options and an impressive selection of coffee to choose from. The location of the hotel is excellent – close to everything we wanted to explore in Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nAs a Gold Accor Member, I felt the service and attention to detail were exceptional. I highly recommend Sofitel Saigon to anyone planning a visit to this vibrant city. You won’t be disappointed!"

I was particularly impressed with the breakfast, which was one of the best I have had in terms of range of options and quality. The decor throughout the main parts of the hotel feels modern and exclusive.\n\nI only gave this hotel four stars for two reasons:\n\n1. When ordering an evening meal at the roof top bar I gave a very specific dietary request. Unfortunately, this was ignored but also the meal took a long time to be served, so I had my meal after my fellow guests had already finished.\n\n2. Although the rooms are nice, they are not as modern or hi-tech as other hotels I have been to in Vietnam. I don’t feel that the accommodation rooms reflect the decor of the rest of the hotel. I also don’t feel that whoever has designed/configured the rooms have used the space effectively. For example, there was a desk and large mini bar taking up a lot of space in the middle of my room. There was a recliner chair place under a large ceiling hung lamp, that you hit your head on if you sit in the chair. Had the desk and mini bar been against a wall, perhaps a nice comfortable seat and coffee table could have been provided next to the window.\n\nA nice hotel, but slightly disappointed with the service and room. I would go back and recommend it to friends."

Hotel staff were so friendly and wonderful on arrival and assisted us to our room swiftly.  We were given a high foot with excellent views so that we could see the parade which was very interesting for us.  Staff member. Fox - the bellboy, arrived with our luggage and was most polite, kind and informative with excellent English language skills.  We dined at ST25 by Koto and it was excellent and most delicious. Even though it was a very busy evening in the restaurant the staff were attentive and accommodating.  Rooms were very comfortable and clean."

I chose this property based on numerous positive reviews and its 5-star reputation. Unfortunately, their experience was anything but reflective of that standard.\n\nUpon arrival, they were asked to provide their booking number. My mother showed the Hotels.com confirmation email, but the check-in staff insisted it wasn’t the correct reference and asked them to step aside to find the “right” number. At no point did the staff ask for their names or make any effort to locate the reservation using alternative details. They were simply left waiting and ignored.\n\nAfter more than 30 minutes without any assistance, my distressed parents called me. It was only after I personally contacted the hotel and expressed my frustration that they were finally taken to a room. Even then, no one offered an apology or basic information such as where breakfast would be served or what amenities were available.\n\nThis experience was deeply disappointing and far below what anyone should expect from a hotel of this caliber. What was meant to be a thoughtful and relaxing gesture for my parents turned into a stressful and upsetting ordeal. I expected much better in terms of service, hospitality, and basic human courtesy. I will not be booking this hotel again and cannot recommend it to others."

The main dissatisfaction being the temperature of the water changing from hot to cold regularly while showering and general feeling that the room feels dated. However these little things are more than made up by the stellar service of all the staff in the hotel... And I mean all!... From the bell boy, pool staff, restaurant wait staff or the lounge staff, there was always a friendly smile and willingness to assist. In particular I noticed the attentiveness and extra mile the lounge staff went for their guests... Eg on one side I observed a lounge staff member sitting with a solo guest for at least 15 mins listening to him talk about his life while on the other side I noticed lounge staff giving me the privacy I desired with my laptop and headphones (but always on hand for that extra drink or request)... I get the sense that the staff are not just \"dialling it in\". For me the service of this hotel is the standard to beat in my other hotel stays in the future and I think the hotel management should be proud to have such a great team. Thank you and I look forward to staying here again in the future."

This five-star property truly lives up to its reputation for relaxation and refined Japanese hospitality.\n\nFrom the moment I arrived, I was greeted by the warm and professional staff at the front desk. Tracy, in particular, went above and beyond to ensure my check-in process was smooth and personalized. She took the time to explain all the hotel amenities and even offered recommendations for local attractions. Her attention to detail and genuine smile made me feel instantly welcome.\n\nThe room was absolutely stunning - spacious, modern, and impeccably clean with a minimalist design that created a sense of tranquility. The marble bathroom with its separate soaking tub and walk-in shower was luxurious, and I appreciated thoughtful touches like the electronic Toto toilet system and high-quality toiletries. The 42-inch flat-screen TV, complimentary high-speed Wi-Fi, and comfortable workstation made it perfect for both relaxation and business needs.\n\nOne of the highlights of my stay was dining at La Brasserie. The restaurant staff there deserves special recognition for their exceptional service. They were knowledgeable about every dish, attentive without being intrusive, and always ready with thoughtful recommendations. The international buffet breakfast was simply outstanding - possibly the widest selection I've ever seen at a hotel. Their seafood dinner buffet was equally impressive, featuring unlimited lobsters, crabs, and oysters that were fresh and delicious.\n\nI also had the opportunity to visit the 5 Senses restaurant on the ground floor, which offers modern Japanese cuisine with creative flair. The presentation of each dish was like a work of art, and the flavors were extraordinary. Again, the staff's expertise and friendly demeanor enhanced the dining experience.\n\nThe hotel's facilities are top-notch. The outdoor pool provided a peaceful retreat after a day of exploring the city. The fitness center was well-equipped with modern machines, and the spa services were rejuvenating. I particularly enjoyed spending time in the Nikko Club Lounge on the 23rd floor, which offers spectacular views of the city along with complimentary refreshments throughout the day.\n\nWhile the hotel is located slightly away from the main tourist areas, this actually became an advantage as it provided a peaceful sanctuary away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The complimentary shuttle service to major attractions made it convenient to explore Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nWhat truly sets Hotel Nikko Saigon apart is its staff. From the concierge team who helped arrange tours and transportation, to the housekeeping staff who maintained the room to perfection, to the attentive servers at all dining venues - everyone demonstrated the highest level of professionalism and genuine care for guests.\n\nHotel Nikko Saigon has definitely become my go-to accommodation in Ho Chi Minh City. The combination of luxurious amenities, exceptional dining options, and outstanding service makes it well worth the price. I'm already looking forward to my next visit!"

When I was enjoying Seafood buffet at while staying at the hotel, the roast beef was a bit too raw and tough for me. I cut off parts I did not like, and it was cleared by the server named Nguyen Yen Nhi. She looked closely at my plate and reported something to her manager. Then the manager Tran Van Than(Robert) came up to me and asked what I did not like about the food. He apologized for the food condition then offered me to bring some stake to my taste. Ms. Nguyen and Robert constantly looked after my table and were very attentive. Food was amazing, but the thing touched my heart  was staff's service level.\n\nThanks to their service I will strongly recommend my friends and family to stay at the Nikko Saigon, and to try the seafood buffet even if they don't stay at different hotel.\n\nThank you so much for perfecting my stay."

Overall, this hotel is a piece of luxury tranquility just outside but close enough to the hustle and bustle of Saigon.  Highly recommended."

The hotel immediately offered to change the booking although it was a non-changeable and non-refundable booking. The hotel is located in a quiet residential area right by the river. The view on the river from the hotel rooms is amazing. If you know Saigon, then you know how loud it usually is. I never expected to find a hotel located so centrally that is so quiet and peaceful – sitting on the balcony with the fan on low speed and dimmed lights is incredibly relaxing, especially if you have spent the day in the loud center of the city. The room is very clean, large and also has a large bathroom with everything you need. Bed is big and comfortable. The staff is very attentive and helpful. Cocktails on the rooftop bar are good, although a bit (too) sweet. For Vietnamese standard the breakfast is good. Don’t expect all options that you usually find in western hotels. I hope I will come back soon."

Our rooms were immaculate and truly gorgeous with the added personal touch of our initials on the pillows.  The hotel was so scenic, from their large pool, to the flowery arbours, to the gorgeous view of the Saigon skyline at nighttime. 🌇\n\nThe food in the restaurant was delicious and we tried many of the dishes for breakfast everyday. 🍜 The staff there were warm and friendly as well as accommodating. They even had a gym which is not usually available in Vietnam I was told. I couldn’t have asked for more and wish my stay there was longer.\n\nI would totally recommend anyone travelling to Vietnam to stay here you will not be disappointed.\n\nAngela"

Unfortunately, this most recent stay—7 nights in total—was a real letdown. Before booking, the hotel confirmed in writing that we would receive an upgrade upon arrival. When we got there, they refused to honor it, even after we showed them the written confirmation.\n\nWorse, the hotel has become increasingly petty with charges. At 10:37 AM—just seven minutes after breakfast officially ended—my wife asked for a simple bottle of water. They gave it to her then charged us $9 for it and refused to remove the charge at checkout, despite the circumstances.\n\nWe paid for all other charges without issue, but this kind of behavior is disappointing and unworthy of a hotel that used to pride itself on service. Sadly, Mia Saigon isn’t what it used to be, and we won’t be returning."

It is incredible that as a 5 star hotel you have not taken into account these challenges and inconveniences it has for hotel guests. After all, it is a hotel that is located far from the noise of the city precisely so that you can get peace and a good night's sleep. Likewise, their breakfast area had the air conditioning turned off. At the hotel you could choose to sit outside in their terrace area or inside. The hotel chose to open all the sliding doors and then they think it is cool enough. Maybe, but just not us tourists who are not used to 39 degrees in the shade. I asked if they could not close the sliding doors and turn on the air conditioning because it was quite hot to sit there and eat breakfast. But this could not be done. My advice to the hotel is that as a 5 star hotel you should have the opportunity to eat breakfast at 22 degrees and not 35-40 degrees. Overall a sad experience the 2 nights we had in Mia hotel"

From the moment I arrived, the hospitality was top-notch. A special shoutout to Sabrina and her amazing team who truly went above and beyond to make my stay exceptional.\n\nI was delighted to receive a complimentary upgrade, which made my stay even more comfortable. The residence itself was beautifully appointed, offering all the amenities one could ask for. The attention to detail in the room was impeccable, making it feel like a home away from home.\n\nWhat really made my stay special was the thoughtful birthday amenity I received. It was a wonderful surprise that made my birthday even more memorable. Additionally, the team was incredibly accommodating by offering a late checkout, allowing me to enjoy the property just a little bit longer.\n\nOverall, the InterContinental Saigon Residences exceeded my expectations in every way. The service was impeccable, the accommodations luxurious, and the little personal touches made all the difference. I can’t thank Sabrina and her team enough for making my stay so special. I highly recommend this property to anyone looking for an exceptional experience in Saigon."

On the positive side, the apartment is spacious and well-furnished, making it a comfortable stay for us. The housekeeping service was also good and attentive.\n\nHowever, I an disappointed with a few aspects. Despite the high rent, the hotel does not provide basic amenities like water, detergents , dish ckeaner, and washroom accessories. Instead, they expect you to buy these essentials from outside, which I found unreasonable.\n\nAdditionally, the hotel has a very strict visitor policy, which was inconvenient for us. The apartments, although spacious, felt more like hotel rooms.\n\nOverall, while residence has its positives, the drawbacks left a sour taste. If they could revisit their policies and provide basic amenities, I would consider staying here again."

From the check in process to the check out, everything went by flawlessly.\n\nWhen we arrived, we were welcomed with their refreshing welcome drinks, and brought to the Club Lounge on the 18th floor. We were warmly greeted by Ms. Chau, who was an absolute gem and the most amazing person. She took the time to give us so many suggestions and recommendations, and her warmth was so infectious. ❤️\n\nSince I am travelling with my parents, they arranged an additional bed for us to ensure we would be comfy throughout our stay. The birthday cake and heartfelt message for my mom was really wonderful, my mom truly appreciated it.\n\nWe also reached out to the fellow navigator at the lobby, Mr Shawn who was so friendly and helpful. He managed to help us snag last minute tickets for the cruises (we checked online and they were sold out), and my parents were really pleased.\n\nAt Viet Restaurant during breakfasts, Ms. Ngo would greet us warmly every morning, and always make sure we enjoyed our meals. We enjoy her warm hospitality, and even tried some of her food recommendations. If you don't have enough time to venture out, the restaurant itself still serves many delicious local foods, and they do differ across the different days we were staying, so we really enjoyed the cuisines there.\n\nThe location itself is truly unmatched - it is at the heart of district 1, and there is plenty to do and see, especially at night. During the weekends, they would close the roads at the Nguyen Hue street, so there are many families and friends alike walking there and playing kites. It truly is a vibrant, bustling city, and the Renaissance Riverside is the best base to explore Saigon. Cảm ơn bạn rất nhiều ❤️ I can't wait to come back 🤗"

From the moment we arrived, the service was exceptional—warm, attentive, and truly personalized. A special shoutout goes to the breakfast team, especially Steve, who went above and beyond each morning to make us feel welcomed and cared for. Their genuine hospitality set the tone for the entire stay.\n\nThe hotel’s executive lounge was another standout feature. It does get busy at peak times, but it’s so much more than the typical club lounge experience. Every evening, there was a full buffet dinner spread with a wide range of delicious options, making it well worth the upgrade to a platinum or club level room.\n\nWe also made good use of the amenities—both the men’s and women’s areas had excellent steam rooms and saunas, and the gym was impressively well stocked with modern equipment.\n\nHighly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a blend of comfort, convenience, and top-notch service in the heart of Saigon. We’re already looking forward to our next visit!"

But one incident in particular demonstrated the top notch customer service culture of this hotel.\n\nTo keep the story short, I lost my phone during a grab ride and I was devastated seeing my phone all the way in the other side of the city (tracked using Find My Device). Finally was able to reach the driver but he didn't speak any English. I ran up to the roof top bar and was able to get immediate urgent help from Lani and Tam.\n\nLani and Tam helped translate and even arranged a taxi to pick up my phone, instructed the taxi driver to make sure to accompany me, and to drive me back to the hotel (this was late in the evening).\n\nI was able to retrieve my phone thanks to Lani and Tam going above and beyond. I was able to salvage my phone and along with it all of the happy memories from this trip (and many other precious memories).\n\nIn addition to this incident, the kitchen staff, housekeeping staff, and concierge, were all very pleasant. I'm definitely staying here again if I visit Ho Chi Minh again. Many thanks!"

Notably, Steve at breakfast was one of the most helpful and friendly team members we interacted with- he seemed genuinely interested in ensuring we had a great experience in the city, and was super attentive with all guests at breakfast.\n\nThe room we stayed in was really clean quiet, and well maintained. The bed was really comfortable, and the linens were always clean. The room was well equipped and stocked with enough plugs, easy to use temperature control and switches, and all the toiletries we needed. I was most impressed by how timely the room was cleaned - we were never disturbed while we were in the room but even when we left for 10 minutes the room would be cleaned.\n\nI would definitely stay at the riverside renaissance again, and highly recommend the hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and enjoyable experience in Ho Chi Minh."

The work continued past midnight, making it quite noisy. If you’re a light sleeper, getting rest might be a challenge. You might want to top up a little more and get river view.\n\nI tried calling reception to request a room change, but no one answered. The next day, I asked in person, but the only available option was a room three floors lower with the same view. On the third day, construction started again around 7 AM—an unexpected wake-up call for breakfast.\n\nDuring checkout, Julie’s sincere apology was appreciated and left a positive impression. Overall, the room condition was good, but the ongoing construction next door was a drawback.\n\nThe breakfast was excellent—I especially enjoyed the croissant and pho."

I'd suggest they improve this experience. Thanks.\n\nPREVIOUS:\n\nI've just checked in today....and I've stayed in all the marriott operated hotels in Saigon and this is the first time I've had this issue so I am quite dissappointed in the service this time.\n\nThere's construction going on right next to my room (see the photo). I am here for work and it's very noisy while I am trying to rest and then trying to have work calls. I don't blame the hotel for the the construction, BUT the appropriate thing to do is to INFORM the customer well beforehand so I am aware and can decide to stay or not or request a different room. They've also given me a room that has a connecting door which they should have informed me about.\n\nOverall service is fine and everyone is welcoming and rooms are standard is fine, but my issue is how the communication has been handled for this.\n\nI hope this reaches management so they can prepare better ommunication next time.

If your sleep is light, slighty noisy due to motorways, but most likely the same in hotels in district 1"

The rooms were very clean, spacious, and had an elegant, high-end feel, yet still represented great value for money.\n\nI booked two rooms for a trip with my mother during her birthday. Without any request from us, the hotel had taken note of the occasion and thoughtfully delivered cake to her room on her birthday. It was a wonderful and memorable gesture.\n\nThe hotel is located away from the central tourist areas, but it's only a 10-minute Grab ride to the Saigon Central Post Office, making it very convenient to reach the main attractions.\n\nThe staff were very friendly, helpful, and kept the rooms super clean throughout our stay. The full buffet breakfast was impressive, plentiful, varied, and better than many 5-star hotels we have stayed in.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone looking for quality, comfort, exceptional value for money, and thoughtful service in Ho Chi Minh City."

A cafe style restaurant and Hong Kong Chinese restaurant. We ate in both. The cafe in the lobby was fine. The Chinese upstairs was more fine dining, but had no guest except us and another table, so a bit soulless. The menu was very complicated and difficult to understand, and we are hardened travellers, but we managed to order something to eat with a bit of help! I personally think the menu is putting the guests off, as it's way too large and hard to understand. Make it simple and much smaller, and my guess is you will be much busier!!\nThere is not much worth seeing around the hotel. We did have a quick wonder, but quickly went back, so if you are after a hotel near airport then yes, if not, I would not pick this one again! Even though it was very comfortable!!"

While we informed the staff, their response (offering free takeaway fruit) felt inadequate for the price and reputation of the resort.

We especially enjoyed the Sunrise Yoga, massage treatments at the spa and our evening rooftop drinks in the bar. The rooms were gorgeous, super spacious, immaculately clean and beautifully decorated. The ambience around the hotel, with all the plants, ponds and walkways was spectacular. The staff at the restaurant were really helpful and the breakfast buffet blew our minds. We took a boat ride into the city one evening for dinner, which was a lovely touch. We really enjoyed being out of the hustle and bustle and being able to travel into the city when we wanted to (Grab into the city is only about £5-7, so not an issue at all). I was made to feel very special with all the extra birthday treats too. I could go on and on about how fabulous this place is, but I'll just say, thank you!"

The proximity to other hotels, bars and entertainment meant there was very loud music playing frequently throughout the day and night. The staff were helpful in offering us another room but I think the sound is unavoidable given the location. The ‘butler’ service is a little misleading. You are in 24/7 WhatsApp communication which, although helpful for booking treatments and room service, means your butler will contact you unnecessarily when you are trying to relax. We were messaged at 20:30, when out for dinner using the babysitting service, asking about a missing flannel in our bedroom and on another occasion messaged about a broken glass found in our room and warned there would be a charge for this. I have no issue with being charged for broken items (though do find this surprising in a hotel with rooms at a high price point) but didn’t appreciate being messaged at all hours with issues from housekeeping when trying to relax on holiday. If you are interested in using the babysitting service, be aware that it is reliant on your butler being available at the time you want/need.\n\nOverall, a pleasant stay, but the noise and unwanted messages received means we probably wouldn’t return."

It is a peaceful jungle type retreat. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. There are villa rooms with their own pool. There is a lounge on an upper level where you can sit and enjoy a drink and a nice view of the Saigon River.\nThere is only one restaurant serving a range of local and international foods. The service is very friendly but when we were there a little haphazard. I would recommend the hotel for a visit if you want a few quiet days at the end of a busy trip to Vietnam."

You might think that the rooms are not up-to-date due to the wooden design. But wow, they are really spacious and beautiful. The two-way complimentary boat ride is a true highlight, as are the private sauna rooms which are just amazing.\n\nI would like to highlight the very kind reception team - especially Ms. Anh (Anna) who was amazing!\n\nDuring our stay the main kitchen was under renovation. There was some miscommunication regarding this issue but the staff offered us a complimentary upgrade to an incredibly large suite which was much more of a compensation than expected and very kind of them. The manager also approached us and apologized - very nice and I have never experienced a resort dealing with a small inconvenience in such a kind way.\n\nDuring our stay, it was only possible to dine at the resort‘s event location (Song Garden). I have to say that the food was not perfect - especially what they offered for breakfast. The Banh Mi and Com Tam were basically tasteless and some other items on the buffet were just average. They did offer sparkling wine, though, which was nice.\n\nThe quality of the food might have been affected by the kitchen renovation. However, the service there was also average and slow. This is something they could improve."

It was the most expensive hotel but, once you see the hotel and the service, you fully understand. You get what you pay for and the service was great.\nIt was just my wife and we selected a room without really reviewing what was available so we wound up with the smallest room they had, which was the smallest room of all of the hotels of any stayed at during every visit to Vietnam over the years but, we has sufficient room for our needs, we did not feel cramped and the room was beautiful. The hotel is directly above the Saigon Centre shopping center with a food court on the top and bottom floors as well as a grocery store so we had easy access to food, shopping and drinks. Ben Than market, Vinacom center and many tourist sites are less than 10 minutes away by foot as well. The site is at the intersection of a number of major roads so traffic in the vicinity of the hotel is high.\nWe ate one night at the hotel Restaurant and the food was fantastic. There are two other restaurants at the hotel but, we did not have time to try them though one was advertising a Michelin star."

We stayed on the 35th floor and our room was luxurious. We were higher than all of the surrounding buildings making the view spectacular.  Our room had a separate room with a kitchen, large dining table and spacious seating area with a tv. The bedroom was comfortable with crisp sheets, luxurious mattress and large bathroom. Every morning we enjoyed the breakfast buffet serving gourmet hot foods, fresh fruits, cereal station and fresh baked breads. In addition to the buffet they also offer a separate menu to order other dishes from. The employees are all trained in 5 star service standard. The employee who stood out for us was a man named Max at breakfast. Max went above and beyond remembering our room number and coffee orders every morning we arrived. We stayed during a holiday weekend and the hotel was busy with many people but we still felt like VIP guest from the time we walked into the building. The hotel is attached to the Saigon Center making it easy to shop, go to the gym (included for hotel guest) and especially dining. We were sad to leave the luxuries but excited we were able to enjoy this hotel."

The shower had amazing water pressure, which was such a nice touch after a day out in the city. Unfortunately our flight from Da Nang was delayed for the whole day which shortened our stay, and I appreciated that they had fresh fruit in the room for us because it was too late to get dinner anywhere else.

Worth mentioning that this property is a 20-30 minute taxi ride into District 1, depending on traffic.\nUpon arrival we were informed that they no longer offer the boat service. Not sure why, the reception attendant offered a vague excuse about “the city doesn’t allow us to have the boat service”, something like that. I think at the very least, we should have been informed in advance as this is a main selling point of the hotel. They did offer to pay for one taxi per day into the city, after we expressed our dissatisfaction.\nOur room was very comfortable, with a nice bed, view to river, good sheets, towels and pillows and a decent bathroom. The pool area is a bit tired; could do with an upgrade to the lounge chairs (stained cushions) and a paint job on the walls. The outdoor dining area, over the river, is very pleasant and the service is attentive.\nProbably the best of this hotel is the dining. Excellent food. We had both “western” style breakfast as well as Vietnamese style and all were simply incredible. They have a strange beverage policy at breakfast; you can have either a coffee, or a juice. But if you want both, they charge you for one. 🤷🏻‍♂️\nDon’t bother with the cocktails, watered down. Stick to beer and/or wine.\nAlso worth mentioning that the property right next door is in the construction phase. It seems like a lot of the materials are delivered in the middle of the night, with men screaming, trucks in and out, and literally a CHAINSAW running for 10-15 minutes at around 1am. This is clearly not the fault of the hotel, but it was rather inconvenient one night.\nAll in all, a pleasant stay with a couple minor glitches. If the boat were running, would probably give 4.5 stars."

And wow, what a stunning location!\n\nNestled right beside the Saigon River, the villa exudes an air of tranquility and elegance. The lush greenery, beautiful architecture, and serene river views create a truly captivating atmosphere. Even from my brief visit, I could sense the peacefulness and luxury that this boutique hotel offers.\n\nIf the ambiance and location are anything to go by, I'm sure Villa Song Saigon provides a memorable and relaxing stay. I'm already planning a future visit to experience their hospitality and soak in the tranquil riverside vibes."

The villa is a boutique hotel on the river in this quiet neighbourhood - a perfect place to come home to after a day of sightseeing. There are also some great little bars and restaurants only a short walk away.\n\nThe highlights of the hotel are the friendly staff, the relaxing oasis of a pool and the complimentary speed boat transfers to the city centre. That’s right, arrive in the city centre on the villa’s private speedboat. Would definitely recommend this hotel and wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again"

The pasta noodle should be softer. Everything is nice especially its along the river. The lunch was good until so much noise from 2 people talking and the staffs didnt tell them to say less louder. They have an online meeting with louder speaker. The environment should be kept quiet to get a long with the theme. The restaurant looks nice and i like it. Staffs in general are polite and friendly."

They addressed concerns that were brought up in previous reviews, which was quite impressive and upgraded us to a larger, lovely room that was available.\n1. The breakfast, which was a La carte, was fantastic. My husband’s eggs Benedict was perfection, and my spring rolls were light, fresh and tasty. A previous review was unhappy that only one beverage was included. Now, two beverages are included.\n2. Wi-Fi worked well, as they had the system upgraded.\n3. As others commented, the speed boat to District 1 (which is one reason we stayed there) was in the shop, but the management paid for a taxi into town. This is one reason I scored it low on location. Definitely inconvenient if you are taking any tours, as we found most companies will not pick you up from District 2.\n3. The pool was warm and inviting after a long day of checking out the sights around HCMC.\n4. Another great perk was that the mini-bar items were included in the room rate. More hotels should do this. There were waters, sodas, juices and beer"

But after discovering some nice restaurants in District 2, I decided to try staying there for more peace and quiet. Villa Song Saigon was perfect in that regard. At first, I just booked 1 night, in case I decided to go back to District 1. But after thoroughly enjoying the hotel that first night, I ended up booking my entire stay there (4 nights).\n\nThe building itself is gorgeous, a colonial style mansion with 3 floors. If you appreciate the charm of an old luxury boutique hotel, this place will not disappoint, with dark wood floors, high ceilings with custom woodwork and balconies overlooking the pool or river. I stayed in a Sanctuary Room. It wasn't too big (32 sq m) but had everything I needed, including a nice workspace for my laptop.\n\nGetting to District 1 is around a 20-30 minute Grab ride, depending on traffic. The most i ever waited for a Grab was around 3 minutes, so not a problem getting transportation from here at all. During the day, they operate a free boat shuttle, which will drop you off right in the heart of District 1 in only 15 minutes. You just need to schedule it in advance (usually 1 hour).\n\nFree breakfast on the river every morning was a great way to start each day, and live music at the restaurant weekend nights (F,S,S) was also a nice touch if you don't feel like venturing out. Being that District 2 is more upscale (and has a large ex-pat community), there is a wide variety of nice restaurants and bars within a 15 minute walk or 5 minute Grab ride.\n\nKudos to the staff for making my stay so enjoyable. I'll be back!"

Was disappointed as my room faced an interior smoking area which had bright fluorescent lights. The curtains in the room did not black out the light which made it harder to sleep.\n\nAlso noticed ants in my room in the morning on the counter where there was no food and made me concerned about maintenance at the hotel. I suppose it is one of the oldest hotels in Saigon.\n\nFront desk staff was kind and did their best to help although no refunds were issued when I tried to correct the length of my stay. Initially I requested to shorten my stay during the timing guidelines, I was told my third party booking company needed to request the change in writing. I reached out to the booking company and they said they would request, but never did. The hotel later refused to grant an exception. Aligned with their policy, yes. Customer friendly, no.\n\nWas the experience strong enough to encourage another stay? Likely no.\n\nBreakfast was alright, but more aligned to spreads I've seen at 3-4 star hotels. If you want more authentic Vietnamese coffee with breakfast, be prepared to go to the rooftop and pay extra."

The noise from the floor above me (level 12) was unbearable, resembling a nightclub with loud karaoke. I reported the issue to the staff, but unfortunately, I was informed that there was nothing they could do. This was particularly frustrating since I had an early morning tour scheduled and expected a restful night.\n\nWhile I appreciate the hotel's amenities and service, the noise issue significantly impacted my stay.

The staff is available 24/7 and always helpful. The breakfast was very diverse, with high-quality products.\n\nThe only downside was when I ordered an omelette at the bar near the entrance — there was no mention of any meat or pork, yet it was served with meat on top as decoration. I asked for a new one, and while they did bring another, it still had the taste of meat on the parts that had been in contact. I ended up not eating it.\n\nAside from that, everything was great. The welcome was warm and the room was absolutely perfect."

I was given the option between a city view or a river view, and I'm glad I chose the hustle and bustle of the city—it was a captivating sight. That said, the staff absolutely made the stay memorable—friendly, attentive, and genuinely eager to help with any request.\n\nOne small critique: the cocktail bar could use more variety in its menu. It wasn’t bad by any means, just a bit limited for a hotel of this caliber. If you’re a business traveler seeking comfort, convenience, and stellar service, this is a reliable choice.\""

We were very impressed with the level of service.\nEvery staff performed beyond and above expectations.\nSpecial mention to the team at the Club Lounge. Obviously very well trained and good teamwork. In addition, the evening cocktail hour from 6 to 8 pm was a treat!\nThe level of the selection on offer was quite amazing.\nWe were here for 6 nights and not once was the buffet repeated.\nOur Studio suite was extremely comfortable and spacious.\nHousekeeping did a brilliant job each day.\nBreakfast team & quality was very efficient & tasty too.\nOverall, the Sheraton Saigon Grand Opera though is an old property, the soul of the team shines bright!"

From the staff at the lobby who opened every door we walked out of to the friendly employees at the gym and club lounge, everyone was kind and genuinely interested in providing excellent service. The breakfast buffet was incredible and will delight even the pickiest palates.  On our second morning at breakfast, our hostess walked us over to our table and asked if my husband and I both wanted lattes with oat milk like we had the previous morning.  The same hostess helped me the following day to gather some fresh squeezed watermelon juice to bring up to my husband who wasn’t feeling very well and couldn’t make it to breakfast.  The attention to detail by the employees is truly incredible. All the employees were on top of it! They even have a real juice bar and they squeeze juices to order-if you follow MM, they even have fresh celery to juice for you!\nTheir club lounge for Bonvoy elite members is equally impressive. They offer breakfast, afternoon tea and their happy hour offers a huge spread so you can easily eat your dinner there.\nVery impressive hotel and if we ever find ourselves back in HCMC, we know where to stay"

Our room was very comfortable and clean.\nWe were celebrating my husband’s birthday, and the thoughtful gesture of a small cake was a lovely surprise.

The complimentary drinks (soft and alcoholic) were a nice touch, and the service provided by Lam, Henry and Chris was exceptional - they made fantastic cocktails!\n\nWe also enjoyed the open-air swimming pool on the 47th floor, which, while not too deep, provided a refreshing experience with stunning city views.\n\nFor convenience, we booked a private airport transfer with the hotel in a Mercedes E-Class, and everything went smoothly.\n\nThe location of the hotel worked well for us. It’s in a quieter riverside area, yet just a short drive from major attractions and the airport.\n\nAll the staff we interacted with were professional and helpful, making our stay truly enjoyable.\n\nWe would 100% stay again!"

Beds are comfortable and amenities are complete.\n\nLocation wise, it is just across the road from the Saigon Opera House and easily accessible from the new HCMC metro.\n\nWhile the hotel does offer a late check-out option for a small fee, it is understandable that the hotel was fully booked during the Reunification Day celebrations. Would love to extend our stay here a little longer. No complaints though, we managed to watch firework shows from our room on 2 nights.\n\nOverall, a fantastic stay!"

If you don't have your dnd button pushed cleaning staff comes by 3 times or more which can get excessive if your trying to rest. Front reception is also not friendly. Went to another hotel in the south of Vietnam and it was a stark difference with exceptional customer service and feeling welcomed. For the price you pay at this hotel I would have expected higher standards of customer service. We stayed 9 days and the day we left one person working there actually said hi and spoke to us (we are super friendly people)"

However the clients next door kept it very loud I couldn’t sleep when actually the next morning I had to wake up at 5am.\n\n*THE WORST THING WAS THE RECEPTIONIST ASKING ME IF I WAS SENSITIVE TO NOICES* IGNORING EVERYTHING I EXPLAINED THAT THE NEXT DOOR WAS VERY LOUD. Luckily the bell boy also heard a very loud noise when he help picking up the luggages in the room, so he helped me with the statement.\n\n1) This should not be the way you solve the problem. You cannot select the guests, but you can have a good system when it comes to any possible situation.\n2) The service, the staffs should be trained on how to treat the guests when they receive the complaints. This case, I felt like I was questioning as a reason of the complaint and without any investigation on the fact if the guests next noise really made noise or not.\n\nWhat a waste of the hotel’s great location, fantastic food and facilities.\n\nHonestly I would not come back."

The check-in process was painfully slow, taking much longer than expected even though we had confirmed our booking well in advance. Worse, during check-in, the staff mishandled our documents and gave my client’s passport to another guest — a serious breach of security and trust.\n\nIn addition, there were clear signs of discrimination during our stay. My European guest was allowed to use the restroom on the 7th floor without any issue. However, when my Vietnamese guest tried to do the same, they were refused access. This treatment is absolutely unacceptable and shocking in a professional hospitality environment.\n\nGiven the level of unprofessionalism and discriminatory behavior we experienced, I cannot recommend this hotel to anyone, especially to those traveling with diverse groups. Management seriously needs to retrain their staff and review their policies"

Fabulous breakfast buffet at about 700,000 VND (about 2,100 INR or 28 USD). Reviews said the laundry was expensive (no price list in the room and we are told to ask at the front desk; I don't know why). So, got it done in one of the numerous laundromats we found on Google. Good gym and swimming pool (ask for yoga mat if you need one). The toilet washer malfunctioned repeatedly after four days and the front desk immediately offered us another room but we declined as it would've been a hassle. They sent up a fruit basket to mollify us, and gave us a 4 pm checkout.! Very courteous staff. Lots of inexpensive restaurants behind the hotel and small convenience stores, massage parlours and coffee shops. Got a free airport drop (not sure if it's included in the price). Next time, I might check out hotels and service apartments in District 2 as the area seems interesting."

Good thing we double checked the amount and came back. I’m pretty sure I got shorted around 200k dong the night before because I didn’t get a receipt and didn’t double count. Always make sure you get a receipt and make sure you double count the amount you get. Don’t get skimmed by the girls at the front! Can’t be trusted"

Lovely pool for the hot afternoons. Gym, games rooms, even a guest cinema room ! The staff are incredibly helpful. Breakfast is very good. We also had a few lunches which were great as well. Very central location near to the War Remnants museum, Independence Palace, cathedral etc. Perfect for families. My teenager & friend on their gap years joined us here for a few days and were delighted to find the apartment had a washing machine and tumble drier. Very good value for money. A bit of noise from the ubiquitous karaoke bars but you are in a big city, and our apartment had double-double glazing which helped."

It's a typical business hotel with below-average luxury. The housekeeping was unprofessional - our room with twin beds and an additional bed felt like a hostel setup. They charged for the extra bed but didn't provide basic amenities like an extra coffee cup or water. The housekeeping service was slow and unresponsive, requiring multiple calls to get issues resolved. Food was average, but the F&B staff, reception, and bellboys were friendly. However, the balcony was dirty, had pigeon noise, and staff yelling in the corridors at night made it unpleasant. Overall, it's a good hotel for business travelers but not ideal for families seeking comfort and luxury."

It’s about a 30 minute cab ride from the airport. Small 7-11 across the street, multiple chain coffee shops (think Starbucks) across the street. Not many air conditioned restaurants nearby. Towels were old and rough, and mattress was sunken in the middle. Still, it’s a good value overall."

Unfortunately, I was very grossed out by the hygiene standards, which were not what I expected from a five-star hotel. The bathroom had visible mould on the floor and the shower head, and the soap dish was broken. I intentionally left it to see if housekeeping would address it during our four-night stay, but it remained untouched. Additionally, room service did not provide fresh towels, instead they refolded the same ones as I noticed the same makeup stain on the face towel."

I am sitting in the stunning foyer awaiting my taxi and my husband and I are sad to be leaving. The hotel has been a huge contribution to the amazing week we have had in this beautiful country, Vietnam. The first call-out is to the staff. They are so kind and treat everyone so well, with offers of assistance and happy greetings every time you bump into them. The breakfast buffet was delicious, with so many selections. The Premium Club was definitely worth the extra, our room was spacious and lovely. We enjoyed an evening sipping cocktails in the Sky Bar with the beautiful breeze listening to the DJ. And the spa is definitely worth a visit for being spoilt! Thankyou for such a memorable trip, we really do hope to be back!"

There are some good restaurants including Coco near by and you are only 15min walk to key tourist sights or simply take a Grab in warm weather.\n\nMy only improvements would be that they can improve their eco credentials but removing the “miniature” shampoo and shower gels in the rooms. They also have a nice high tea but it could be improved by a clear explanation of what each items is and if the staff check for allergies before serving as there is some alcoholic elements."

Our room smelled like humidity and the AC barely worked leaving a musty smell in the room throughout our stay. The pool area barely has any lounge chairs for the amount of guests and was closed one evening from 6pm for a private event. The pool itself was very underwhelming. Breakfast was ordinary as well nothing memorable and is not complimentary. Location isn’t the best either. Also they have a lounge area that is only for “premium” bookings. Won’t return here for sure."

She was absolutely amazing—friendly, attentive, and always ready with a smile. Her exceptional service truly made my stay extra special.\n\nThe highlight of the hotel is undoubtedly the rooftop bar. The views of the city skyline are breathtaking, especially at sunset, and the atmosphere is just perfect for relaxing after a day of exploring. The cocktails were top-notch, and the staff at the bar were just as friendly and professional.\n\nThe hotel itself is beautiful, clean, and offers a tranquil escape from the bustling city.

The breakfast offered a wide selection of delicious options, and the staff were always friendly. Huệ, the spa manager, was especially wonderful. She recommended the perfect massage tailored to my needs and referred me to the best places to visit in the city. She went out of her way to ensure all my hotel needs were met with great care.\nOne of the standout features of the hotel is the large-sized salt water pool, the only one in Saigon, which added a unique touch to my visit. My patio door opened out to this magnificent pool, offering stunning views and a serene atmosphere in the heart of the city. I am deeply thankful to Huệ for making my stay so memorable. I highly recommend the Equatorial Hotel to anyone visiting Saigon."

The hotel also serves a quality breakfast, even though the quality of the meat can vary strongly per day.\n\nThe hotel could do with some renovations, especially when it comes to the carpets in the rooms and even more so the carpet in the lobby (dirty!). However, some renovations seem to be underway, as the bathroom of our room was recently renovated!\n\nThe location of the hotel is somewhat questionable. There are hardly any restaurants nearby and, even though it is doable, the walk to, for example, the Bui Vien area with lots of eateries is around 30 minutes. Other reviews state a bad neighbourhood, but we do not agree with those reviews at all. The neighborhood is fine, there are just not many options for food and drink outside of the hotel."

At first they couldn't find our booking and made us wait while they checked and then when they finally found it they apologized, called us twice (!!) to give us the wifi code and sent a fruit platter of whole fruits with a butter knife (like sorry but here cut your own fruit)! Secondly we had informed them our airline was going to drop off our bags later (airline issues) but when we asked the bell boys if the bags arrived they said No. However, the bags had been delivered! We went through a hassle of talking between the airline and hotel. The hotel finally did confirm they have the bags! The hotel person came to the airport to drop off our bags but the hotel made us pay for the round trip taxi fare!!! There is no sense of customer service or informing the guests of updates. I would not recommend staying here unless you want bad service!"

The confort is in the details, the service of each personnel, the pool, the bar, the shuttle service was top notch.\n\nThe hotel is just a short 10-15 min Grab away from the action and the daily shuttle makes it super easy to get around.

The hotel was fantastic in accommodating my requirements for the proposal by reserving a table and had a bottle of bubbly ready for us to celebrate the occasion!

I am not even checking in and just visiting my friend who was with me as well at the time. And the worst thing is that, they could have already told us about their policy when we entered the lobby and not when we are already 18 floors up! And they did not say to bring my passport down!

The bedrooms are all pretty standard in terms of size, cleanliness etc. The TV's need to be updated, as do some of the sockets, although you are in VN to watch TV. I like the Breakfast Buffet the best. People are great there and the egg station gives you whatever you want, no matter the hassle.  I always have egg white scrambled eggs, and some hotels don't always do this for your very willingly.  The egg lady eventually just started doing it as soon as it was my turn, without having to say anything!  The river view rooms are a bit noisy and the billboard opposite can be distracting, so if you want a quieter room ask for the city view rooms. The swimming pool and bar on top floor has great views. Pillows can be a bit lumpy, so they may need updating. Mattress is fine, neutral softness.  I can see that many people noted that the front desk staff are not exactly the smiley type.  They definitely have the neutral professional approach to hospitality, so don't expect smiles and welcomes like you might find in Thailand.  I didn't find them to be rude though."

The roof top pool is amazing but if you want to relax by the pool don't expect any sunbeds to be available after 10.00! My one major observation was that the public areas need sprucing up - lots of paint chips off the sill in one restaurant, a great many pool tiles missing etc."

We went to that room and key did not work. Went down and got told we had 0913 instead. The reception fixed it for us afterwards but that was just a weird mistake.\n\nOne of our keycard did not work at the elevator either which was annoying.\n\nWe stayed here for 7 nights, and some days we opt for not having roomcleaning. Everytime we did this they would call at 5 Pm and confirmed with us that we did not want roomcleaning, and they would ask us if we wanted roomcleaning the day after and at what time specifically which felt weird.\n\nAlthough I enjoyed their poolarea, is was just lacking a bit. Their pool tiles was breaking, and you could see it was due to old and poor maintenance.\n\nThe pool had a lot of daypass guests which was fine, but one of the day the hotel had an event, which restricted the pool down to 35%. The infinity pool itself was big and spacious and had incredible view.\n\nOtherwise my stay here was alright, the staff was nice and helpful, (keep in mind I speak Vietnamese) but I felt for the price the hard product should have been better, the hotel as a whole felt a bit run down."

The room is spacious with balcony. breakfast has various choices, also locate on high floor. All The staff are extremely friendly. I have to extend my sincere appreciation to the reception manager Tai, he is so helpful and kind. My boyfriend left his cellphone in a grab car, we couldn't reach the driver, he helped us a lot on translation and communication. Highly recommended this hotel if you stay in Ho chi minh."

From the moment I checked in, everything felt warm, welcoming, and just right. The hotel’s ambiance is stunning—modern yet cozy, and the rooftop pool with a view of the city skyline was absolutely breathtaking.\n\nI even got to celebrate my birthday here, and it felt so special being surrounded by my boss and close friends in such a gorgeous setting. It felt like a home away from home—where every moment was filled with comfort and joy.\n\nThe location is super convenient too! Getting around via Grab was a breeze, and I felt safe the entire time. The staff were all professional, friendly, and accommodating—thank you for making my stay stress-free and memorable.\n\nI also appreciated being allowed to extend my checkout until 6 PM on my last day—this gave me extra time to soak in the view and prepare peacefully for my flight back home.\n\nLa Vela will always hold a piece of my heart. Thank you for being part of such a meaningful chapter in my life. I’ll definitely come back one day. 🧳💙🇻🇳"

They let me check in a little early because the room was ready.\nThe rooftop pool is beautiful with an incredible view.  Palm trees and plants a real nice. The pool is quite large as well.  It gets a bit crowded in the afternoon,  but mornings were pretty quiet with plenty of lounge chairs.  The pool does need some repair since there are missing tiles. But the staff is cleaning it and maintaining the grounds.\nBreakfast is very good with lots of options.\nWill stay again when in HCM city.\nPrice was great for the nights I booked,  but I saw the rate was much higher the previous day, maybe due to demand.\nNice and helpful staff at the front desk and entry.\nGood location on the corner."

The pool is great, on Saturday afternoon I must say it was loud and full of people but we were able to enjoy it during a weekday and it was just perfect to sit there and have some drinks. It would benefit from some maintenance though and there should be more chairs. Lots of breakfast options and the room is huge, excellent comfortable bed. Be mindful its a huge hotel so the service may not be personalized"

Management needs to update the photos to reflect the reality accurately. The difference between what is advertised and what you get is so stark that I felt deceived—it felt like I had booked one hotel but arrived at an entirely different one, which I wouldn’t even consider a 4-star property.\n\nThe rooms, while somewhat similar to the pictures, are outdated and in dire need of renovation. The overall atmosphere is far from what you’d expect for the price and rating.\n\nService was another letdown. While the staff was polite enough, they were far from attentive. At the bar, for instance, it seemed like their phones were more important than their job—there was virtually no service at all.\n\nOverall, I left feeling very disappointed. This hotel simply does not live up to the standard it advertises. My message to management: please be honest about what you’re offering. Selling a level of quality you can’t deliver is unacceptable."

For the Muslim travellers, there is a Mosque that's just next door and you will be able to find a good variety of halal food in the vicinity. There are also nice eateries around the hotel like Japanese, Korean, Western, in the same street there is a nice authentic Italian restaurant called Carpaccio. There is also a nice high-end mini supermarket called the Annam Gourmet just across the street. The guest service is really impressive. I have to mention Ms. Linh, Ms. Giao, Mrs. Hong and Mr. Tuan who went out of their way to ensure all guests feel at home. There is a nice roof top bar on the 10th floor with a small dipping pool for you to enjoy and cool down. All rooms are clean and well design though its a little small. But for its price, you may consider single person per room for more privacy instead of having a room with 2 beds. I would recommend this hotel to my friends and family. Well done to the Icon Saigon Team for the good job!"

Two receptionists greeted us and our check in was a breeze. Our room was on the fourth floor, with a small window. Comfortable bed and good bathroom with dental kit, cotton buds, and comb provided. Bottled water, tea, and coffee available free of charge and the mini fridge was great. Only con was that the walls were quite thin, could hear sounds from the hallway. Sleep was disrupted by that, but the comfort of the bed outweighed that."

Upon check-in, the staff kindly upgraded us to an Executive Suite with 81 square meters, featuring two beds (one double bed and one sofa bed) and two bathrooms. Surprisingly, the room also included a dedicated workspace, complete with a desk and lamp, which was perfect for work.\nModern and Elegant Interior – The stylish and sophisticated design made us feel incredibly cozy.\nBrand-New Appliances – The room was equipped with high-quality appliances, including a washing machine and clothes dryer.\nWell-Maintained Facilities – The clean, large, and heated swimming pool was a highlight, along with the jacuzzi and sauna. Additionally, they offer a gym for adults and an entertainment room for children.\nRich and Diverse Breakfast Options – The hotel provides a breakfast menu with a variety of dishes, including traditional Vietnamese cuisine and Western-style options, all served in an all-you-can-eat format.\nWell-Trained and Hospitable Staff – Even the porters in the lobby greeted every guest with a warm smile, making us feel genuinely welcomed.\nI will definitely choose this hotel again when I visit Ho Chi Minh City next time!"

The free in-room washer and dryer was a huge help with our stay. The location was a great spot in the city, close enough to the main attractions but not a super noisy area and close to some local restaurants. Also was helpful that the hotel is across from a major supermarket (Coopmart) if you need to buy snacks, or other items.\n\nSpecial thanks to the staff here as well as they were extremely helpful and friendly. Highly recommend the suite for family stay (or friends) especially if you're going with a group and would like more extra space."

It included a kitchen, living room, bedroom with balcony access, a very large bathroom with a tub and a washer and dryer which was needed after traveling in Vietnam for about a week.  There was plenty of hot water once we found the switch to turn on the hot water heater.  The breakfast buffet was average for Asian 5 star hotels but the made to order breakfast items made up for that.  This hotel brought back the fine memories we have of the Sherwood Suites in Taipei (no longer there). The one additional item I think would absolutely raise the hotel to 5 star would be to have a doorman open the door for guests.  That may be old fashioned, but it would be a nice gesture."

The rooms were all modern and clean. The window did not insulate noise well so we can hear things from the street but this was very mild compared to how loud it was at other hotels. We didn’t hear any noise from the hallways or next rooms! We weren’t used to having to turn on the water heater before showering but that was again just an adjustment to be made. We wishes the hotel provided laundry detergent for free since there was laundry in the room but again that’s not a huge issue since you can pay for detergent from the lobby or go next door to the giant super market. The gym was also one of the most well equipped and maintained gym we have seen. The staff are constantly in wiping up and cleaning. Amazing value for what we paid, will be definitely be back when we are in Saigon again!"

Location of the building is very close to all tourist attractions like Saigon Post Office etc. It is a luxury apartment known for its cleanliness. We stayed in a two bedroom premiere apartment with spacious rooms, lounge, dining area, two bathrooms with bath tub and hot water and a fully equipped kitchen. Air conditioner and washing machine etc were functioning properly. Wi fi was available. The best place was the spacious balcony where from you can view the  outside road and big office buildings. Facilities include swimming pool, spa, billiard room, fitness centre, children play area and more. Two restaurants provide  in- room dining services. The apartment is well furnished and all required gadgets are available."

The rooms look very old and there was a washing machine right next to the toilet in the bathroom which took up a lot of space. The breakfast didn’t have a lot of options. When I walked into the hotel it didn’t look as nice as the four star hotels. In the room there was a crack on the door. I’m very disappointed in this hotel."

While the staff maintained a smile, it often felt forced and lacked genuine warmth. The rooms were average but clean and well-kept. Coming from an Asian country, we found it a bit unusual that the washrooms didn’t have a health faucet or bidet spray.\n\nThe buffet breakfast was extensive, but the flavors didn’t quite appeal to our palate.\n\nWe would recommend this hotel primarily for its excellent location."

We celebrated our 20 wedding anniversary there and were warmly greeted by the staff and the welcome team. Cute decor and nice gesture of a slice of cake. The room service food was nice too. I want to particularly mention one of the staff members from the breakfast buffet, Ms Anh, who has provided excellent service with a smile and she could even remember my room number when I came for breakfast not on all of the days. while settling the payment, she overheard me saying to my husband there there is no more sparkling water, she promptly made the arrangement together with her team mate to fetch some for us. I think she's gone the extra mile. I did not give a 10/10 rating for the stay because the hair dryer is broken (no hot air blowing out) for room 1601. Didn't want to trouble anyone but I think the housekeeping team should look into it."

In India, we’re used to only women assisting women in spaces like spas and jacuzzis, but Toan handled everything with such grace and chivalry that I felt completely at ease.\n\nAt the front desk, Hung was a star—he proactively helped me with my membership alignment during check-out, personally assuring me he’d take care of it. That level of attention and care really stood out.\n\nAnd then there’s the other Hung, stationed outside the hotel. For all three days, I saw him tirelessly assisting guests with luggage, booking cars, and handling every request with a bright smile and a professional attitude.\n\nPullman  delivers luxury—but it’s people like Toan, Hung, and Hung who make the experience unforgettable."

I don’t think it’s suitable for families with kids or light sleepers, double glazing of the windows doesn’t help. Hotel provides the earplugs, so they are aware of the noise even though try to present it as a location experience. In our case the music was extremely loud till midnight, and after that we were able to sleep. I think for the price, you can consider something less noise in the pretty same location."

Do not be put off because this is a brand you might not have heard of, it was absolutely first class.\nWe arrived at the hotel quite late in the evening and were immediately offered a drink and biscuits, while we checked in. Check in was quick, smooth and efficient and we were soon shown to Room 503 on the fifth floor.\nThe room was a slightly quirky shape, but large for an Asian room and very clean and modern and had a firm but comfortable bed, a large Samsung TV, fridge, safe etc. There was a free mini bar refreshed daily and a lovely modern bathroom, with a very funky shower. Everything felt very premium and was nicely branded with the hotel logo. Towels were thick and the body wash, shampoo and conditioner was all very good quality.\nThe pool was on the rooftop. It wasn't very big, but was never busy enough for that to be an issue. It also had a small gym on the top floor, with TV and free water.\nThe pool area was delightful, with a very arty design and some nice views.\nBreakfast was very nice on a dining room filled with class and character. There was a nice mix of fresh fruit and fruit juices, a small selection of Asian choices and some western staples like croissants, pastries, bacon and sausage, plus an egg station making the most beautiful omelettes.\nNo real negatives to report, pool size maybe, our bed had a slight squeak, but was very comfortable.\nAnd saving the most important point to last. Location. We were a 3 minute walk to Notre Dame Cathedral (which was covered in scaffolding by the way. We were 5 minutes from the Royal Palace and a similar distance to the brilliant War Remnants Museum. The area was full of restaurants of all types and all budgets.\nIf we visit Saigon again and hod willing we will, it's a fascinating city, we would definitely stay at the same hotel."

They even made the room and fill it with balloons to celebrate for our stay. It is wonderful and very thoughtful. The office behind the bed is quiet and cozy . The breakfast area, is good and romantic. Jazzy feel. Not lots of variety but all good quality. Coffee is also top notch. It is in district 3, but w within walking distance to district one like Saigon centre, takashimaya shopping centre etc."

I’ve never gotten charged for a room key before. They didn’t mention that at check in but apparently there’s a sign up front that says it that I didn’t see.\nAlso, the second floor is listed as a work space on the elevator signage but when I went up there to work on my laptop, they told me it was a dining area and I had to buy food or drinks to sit there.\nI did find a hair in the soy rice they served at breakfast.\nThe gym was tiny and the AC didn’t work.

Our safe code stopped working the day before we checked out, we thought it glitched. We asked for housekeeping the day before. When we asked the staff to open the safe for us, we realized the money we left in there was missing. Hotel staff and manager denied any involvement and lied to us that they had video footage of the housekeeper cleaning our room with the door open and that the safe was never touched. After calling the police and demanding they showed us the footage, it was revealed that the room door was closed the entire time, and you couldn’t see the housekeeper or the safe at all. I’m pretty sure everyone was in on it. Normally I would not keep valuables in the safe but I felt I could trust this establishment and unfortunately they proved me wrong. We had such a great time here initially and even overlooked the ant problem (there are ALOT of ants here) but this left a sour taste in our mouth and we would never come back, or could recommend this place to anyone."

I came to this hotel for a workshop in October last year on company business, and I felt that I really wanted to bring my parents here, so I came here during the Lunar New Year holiday. My parents were very satisfied, and due to their excellent location, I was able to enjoy the scenery of the New Year in Vietnam and enjoy the attractions of the New Year's culture. All the hotel employees were kind. In addition, I received the supervisor's outstanding consideration, understanding, and kindness for customers' convenience as a New Year's gift, and I was very grateful that I could stay in Vietnam until the end. When I come to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, in the future, I will stay at this hotel again. Thank you very much for making precious memories of my family trip."

It's a short walk to the cafe apartment. The hotel is air-conditioned, modern, luxurious and welcoming. The pool is outside and feels private even though in the city but also feels like a beach resort pool. With saunas. The rooms have incredible beds and the bathroom is clean smart and a joy to be in.\nI would highly recommend this hotel. I used the hotel app to get clean towels and the service was fast and friendly."

The cleaning staff do a fantastic shop keeping the room tidy, coming even twice a day I noticed. The room is modern and comfortable with stylish furnishings and a large, well-designed, chic bathroom. Not cheap, but not the most expensive hotel either. I’d highly recommend to anyone who can afford to spend the extra amount to stay here."

If you're considering this hotel, think twice—my experience was far from luxurious.\n\n1. **Insects in the Room**: I found insects in my room, which was an incredibly unpleasant and unacceptable experience. While the hotel arranged pest control after I complained, this should never have happened in a high-end property.\n\n2. **Faulty Amenities**: The iron provided by the hotel ruined my shirt beyond repair. When I brought this up to the staff, they were dismissive and refused to take responsibility or offer compensation.\n\n3. **Terrible Customer Service**: The way the management handled my issues was completely unprofessional. I’ve stayed at many hotels, and this was one of the worst customer service experiences I’ve had. Even after following up, I received no meaningful resolution or apology.\n\nThis hotel may look appealing with its central location and modern design, but don’t be fooled. The lack of cleanliness, poorly maintained amenities, and unresponsive service make it a terrible choice.\n\nAs someone who travels often and is usually easygoing, I’ve never felt the need to write a negative review before. This experience, however, was so disappointing that I feel obligated to warn others. Save yourself the frustration and book a hotel that actually provides the service and quality you’re paying for."

While it may not be as massive as some five-star properties, we found it to be the perfect balance of luxury and convenience. With a fantastic mall right at your doorstep, offering top-tier dining and renowned brands, plus world-class amenities, it delivers an unparalleled experience. As a fitness enthusiast, I was absolutely in love with the gym! To top it all off, we were pleasantly surprised with a complimentary room upgrade.\n\nBut what truly sets this hotel apart is its warm, welcoming spirit—a rarity in such a sleek, contemporary setting. The staff's genuine care for guests is evident at every level. A prime example? While heading to the pool—dressed casually in a tank top, shorts, and slippers—I happened to share a lift with the General Manager. Instead of a mere polite nod, he struck up a sincere conversation about our stay and even took an interest in where I’m from. That kind of attentiveness and authenticity flows from top management down to every member of the team.\n\nThe infinity pool with its breathtaking view of Saigon’s skyline was another highlight, making for a perfect retreat. Every detail, from the free minibar and pantry stocked with fresh fruits, a water dispenser, and a coffee machine, added to the seamless experience.\n\nIf I had to point out one minor flaw, the speaker in our room wasn’t working—but we didn’t even bother reporting it since we never needed it. Everything else was flawless.\n\nWe’ll definitely be back!"

The breakfast buffet is  out of this world, the best election and quality of fruits, eggs, french toast/pancakes, Vietnamese noodles/traditional dishes, soups, sushi, coffees/lattes, canapes - the selection changes every morning.  The bed is extremely comfortable, the price is very good compared to other hotels in the area that dont nearly the same quality of amenities or service.  The friendliness of the staff really stands out (with exceptional English), the rooftop twilight sky bar at night is magical with impeccable drinks.  The pool area is a bit small but really nice pool and quality sun loungers on the rooftop.  We absolutely loved the spa as well, dont book anywhere else when staying in Saigion.  Didnt mention the location is so good as well, walking distance to so many sights."

We could just walk around the city, which made everything so easy.\n\nWhat stood out the most, though, was the exceptional service from the staff.\n\nOn our last day, we were worried about getting to the airport on time because the traffic was terrible. But one young male staff member (wearing black glasses) went above and beyond—he literally pulled both of our suitcases and took us to a nearby road with less traffic. He even ran around to find us new taxi and cancel previous one. Thanks to him, we made it to the airport in time.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn’t catch his name, but I truly wish I had—I’d love to come back just to thank him again. Outstanding service. Thank you so much!"

During the check in we received a complimentary lemonade with a variety of fresh fruit as well as a wet towel that was scented and couldn't come at a better time to wipe off the journey. To start with the room it was comfortable, clean, modern and most of all the sleep was blissful. The rooftop bar with the pool provided amazing views and delicious drinks. The breakfast was delicious and the variety was excellent, as well as the atmosphere, which was chic and modern. BUT the most praise deserves the personnel, they went above and beyond to make our stay unforgettable, from packing a breakfast box with coffee as we were unable to attend some breakfast to providing a complimentary drink AND transport to the airport as unfortunately we had to cut our stay short.That kind of service makes this hotel one of the most enjoyable."

The staff stood out for their tentativeness—they were attentive, polite, and quick to assist with any requests, which made the stay more comfortable.\nThe room was clean and well-maintained, though it was a bit on the smaller side, which might be a concern for travelers with lots of luggage or those looking for extra space to relax.\nBreakfast was good, offering a decent selection. However, it was clearly tailored more toward Western tastes, so guests looking for local or more diverse options might find it a bit limited.\nOverall, it’s a solid choice for short stays, especially if you value cleanliness and attentive service."

The overall aesthetic is chic and elegant.\n\nStreet-facing rooms can be a bit noisy. We noticed that pulling the balcony door closed more tightly reduced the noise almost completely. The hotel should consider adjusting the doors so they can be securely closed to block out sound more effectively. Great rooftop bar, though the absence of a pool is still missed."

This boutique hotel is perfectly located in the heart of District 1, close enough to walk to many spots (weather permitting), or it’s super easy to grab a ride from here. It’s far enough from the busiest areas of D1, so you get a bit of peace without sacrificing convenience. I also really enjoyed the coffee shop right next door.\n\nThe standout for me was definitely the staff and service. They were super helpful and communicative, even messaging me through WhatsApp with updates and local tips for food and shopping whenever I asked. Huge thanks to Naccy and the entire front desk team for making everything so smooth!\n\nThe only minor downside is the lack of some typical hotel amenities at this price point, like free breakfast, a pool, or a gym. However, it didn’t take away from how much I enjoyed my stay."

The only reason I'm deducting a star is because the windows are very thin and do not provide enough soundproofing. Since the hotel is located at a busy intersection, it remained quite loud until late into the night. I really hope the M Village group invests in improving this.\n\nThe bathroom does not offer much privacy. The toilet is basically in a \"cubicle\". This concept seems to be a trend in many hotels around the world, but I think most guests would prefer the toilet to be closed off from the rest of the room.\n\nThe staff was the absolute best! Everyone was super friendly and helpful at all times, and a special shout-out goes to receptionist Naccy. I was also very satisfied with the daily cleaning service.\n\nOverall 4.5/5."

The rooms are well equipped, nicely decorated, everything is top quality, some furniture even from top European brands. The location is right in the center of District 1, close to many attractions. There is a very nice coffeeshop and Saigon's best Cigar Lounge & Store (Casa Del Habano) next door. The hotel has a few more and bigger properties close by, at which you can use the swimming pool if you want.\nAlthough this hotel does not have any amenities, the staff is very attentive, super friendly and very helpful. I especially want to highlight receptionist Rosie ❤️ She recommended a very nice Spa and arranged an appointment on very short notice. If you want to visit a decent Spa with high quality service, trust the hotel staff's recommendations, because lots of Spas in that area focus on beautiful girls instead of service quality and skill.\nThank you again Rosie and hope to be back soon."

Close to the airport.\nCons: no elevator and no air con in the common areas, so it was a sweaty hike to my room.\nThis was my last stop before flying home so I just wanted a place to relax but they had construction from morning to 7pm inside the hotel, very noisy.\nThe listing says they have room service and a restaurant but I was told only breakfast was available.\nThe mini fridge in the room didn't seem to be working.\nIt's not walking distance to any sights and to get to food in the area you need to walk along and cross a busy road.\nI arrived around 6pm, which isn't very late, but only met the doorman. I finally met the female owner before check out, which was too late to impart knowledge about the area. The doorman, John, tried to give me information when I arrived but has limited English skills. He pointed me to a restaurant for dinner but couldn't answer my other questions.\nWifi didn't work in my room, I had my own data so I was fine."

I must say that the manager duly informed me of this so that was my fault. In addition the room was a tad small and there are issues with surrounding noise from vendors, karaoke and so on. Wi-fi was spotty too. Aside from that it's great. The staff are very friendly and helpful with anything you need. I must add that the baguettes and the coffee served at bfast are a delight. We bought some for home. Tom, the waiter, bell-hop, and all rounder is great to have around."

He's always there to assist you with coffee and any other needs you may have. I don't know how he does it. the price within reason. Two people one full bed was$60 a night. That is 1200000 dong. A little off the beaten path in this is what in what is called District 3. Maybe only a couple miles from District 1, the main District, but would recommend a taxi and you could get it for around 5 to $6. I should have mentioned they have real coffee.\nPlease keep this in mind that you can get this great place but please try at least 6 weeks in advance. Also if you stay I believe it's five nights they will pick you up at the airport. That will save you at least 5 to $7 if you had to get a taxi. I can only say I highly recommend this place. The only problem I can give is there's no elevator. And remember the owners live here so you must take off your shoes when you enter they're fine establishment. Enjoy Vietnam from the site."

Falling ill while traveling can be daunting, but the staff’s genuine care and attentiveness transformed my experience. They went above and beyond to ensure I was comfortable, offering thoughtful gestures that truly made me feel valued and cared for.\n\nThe hotel’s modern design and impeccable cleanliness are noteworthy. Every corner, from the elegant rooms to the inviting common areas, reflects meticulous attention to detail and a commitment to excellence. The contemporary amenities provided a perfect blend of luxury and convenience, making my recovery and overall stay exceptionally pleasant.\n\nSituated in the heart of District 1, the location is ideal for exploring the vibrant city of Ho Chi Minh. Despite my limited ability to venture out, the serene ambiance within the hotel offered a peaceful retreat from the bustling city life.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend La Siesta Premium Saigon Central to anyone seeking a hotel that combines modern luxury with heartfelt hospitality. Their unwavering dedication to guest well-being sets them apart, and I am truly grateful for the comfort and care I received during my stay."

They were exceptionally friendly, always ready to assist with a warm smile and offer great recommendations for exploring the city. The hotel itself is beautifully designed, with a perfect blend of modern comfort and traditional charm. Our room was spacious, clean, and had all the amenities we needed for a relaxing stay. The location was also ideal, close to major attractions, yet tucked away enough to offer a peaceful retreat after a day of sightseeing. We truly enjoyed our time at La Siesta and highly recommend it to anyone visiting Ho Chi Minh City."

Highly recommend staying here when in Ho Chi Minh.\n\nAfter travelling around Vietnam and staying in various 4 and 5 star hotels we finished our trip in Ho Chi Minh and La Siesta did not disappoint.\n\nWe have very high standards for cleanliness and the rooms were immaculate and housekeeping made sure to keep it that way during our stay.\n\nThe rooms are very comfortable and well laid out and the breakfast buffet has a wide variety. The rooftop pool was a highlight to relax away from the busy city and escape the heat temporarily.\n\nBut, the real highlight of our stay was the service. All of the staff were so friendly and helpful with whatever we needed.\n\nFor example we were checking out very early to catch a flight and they offered us takeaway breakfast/coffee. At breakfast they would ask what hot drinks you would like and they would then remember the next day. It’s these little gestures and attention to detail that truly made this stay incredible."

Room had some ac issues and staff ensured that a technician will come in the next day to confirm nothing was wrong. But after checking at the end of the day, that did not happen and the resolution was to place a dummy hotel card to leave the ac running while we were out. On that regard, this is the first hotel that provided just one single room card (for energy saving purposes I guess?)\n\nFor a seemingly 5-star luxury boutique hotel that you’re paying well above average for, it certainly could have been better in terms of handling such issues. One other aspect would be the breakfast buffet which was split into 2 levels due to lack of space. It just didn’t make sense for guests to go up and down despite having a half buffet on the bottom floor. The coffee was excellently done though by the barista.\n\nNonetheless, the staff did sincerely acknowledged the shortcomings at the end and we are grateful for that."

A special shoutout to Mia, who looked after us so kindly during breakfast each morning—her warmth and attention made our mornings extra special. She made sure that we could try more options from their vegetarian menu since we didn’t eat pork and she also arranged with the kitchen to cook special meals for us which was not part of the menu. The food was absolutely delicious, thanks to the amazing chefs. I was even lucky enough to be given the recipe for Pho, which I can’t wait to try at home!\n\nThe room was always clean and comfortable, with a cozy bed that made it easy to relax after a busy day exploring. The location is perfect too—just a 4 to 5-minute walk to the famous Ben Thanh Market. This hotel truly felt like a home away from home, and we’d gladly stay here again. Highly recommended!"

As soon as we got out of the taxi, a staff member rushed over with umbrellas for us, and he helped with our luggage. There’s a flight of stairs at the hotel entrance, but the staff were quick to assist in carrying our bags up to the lobby and later delivered them to our room.\n\nUpon arrival, we were welcomed with refreshing drinks, fresh fruit, and chilled hand towels. The front desk staff were incredibly helpful, offering great recommendations for restaurants, Vietnamese hair-washing salons, and nail spas—they even helped us make reservation. The service was excellent throughout our stay.\n\nOur room was newly furnished and very comfortable. We had breakfast at the hotel every morning for three days. While the ingredients were similar each day, the preparation and seasoning varied, which kept it interesting and delicious.\n\nThe hotel’s location is also excellent—just a short walk from currency exchange shops and Ben Thanh Market, making everything very convenient."
