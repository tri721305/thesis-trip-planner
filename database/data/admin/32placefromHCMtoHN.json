I was sweating profusely. I couldn't stand it and gave up. I heard that the tunnel for tourists to crawl has been widened. It was narrower back then. It is really hard to imagine how Vietnamese soldiers can fight in Cu Chi tunnels? Even living in a tunnel! ! We don't know much about Vietnamese history itself. Therefore, a Chinese-speaking guide was specially reported to lead the tour, which made the explanation of the whole journey vivid and easy to understand. Trying a short period of Cu Chi tunnels has made myself exhausted, but it is a great experience.",

          "reviewText": "Visiting the Cu Chi Tunnels was an incredible and eye-opening experience, offering deep insights into Vietnam’s history and the resilience of its people. We had booked a tour group, and the bus picked us up from the Old Quarter, making the journey convenient. The ride itself was smooth, and after reaching the site, our guide walked us through the history of the tunnels, explaining how the Vietnamese soldiers dug them by hand using basic tools, enduring immense hardships. These tunnels played a crucial role in their victory during the Vietnam War, allowing them to outmaneuver and resist much stronger forces.\n\nThere are two tunnels that visitors can enter, and going inside was both thrilling and humbling. At times, you have to crawl through extremely narrow spaces, truly experiencing the conditions the Vietnamese soldiers endured. The guide led us through the tunnels, ensuring safety while sharing fascinating details about their strategy, survival techniques, and daily life underground.\n\nIt was a great and lasting experience, making history come alive in a way that books never could. Highly recommend this tour to anyone visiting Vietnam! After the tour, we were conveniently dropped back at the District 1, wrapping up an unforgettable day."

          "reviewText": "I recently visited the Cu Chi Tunnels and it was such an eye-opening and unforgettable experience. Learning about the Vietnam War on-site made everything feel so real and emotional. I was truly amazed by the creativity and resilience of the Vietnamese people—how they were able to live, move, and survive underground in such extreme conditions is just incredible. It’s a powerful reminder of how thinking outside the box can make the impossible possible.\n\nYou actually get to experience the tunnels yourself, and let me tell you—it’s intense! The temperature was around 22°C, which helped, but you still have to bend, squat, crawl, and slide your way through tight, narrow passages. It’s physically exhausting, but also really fun and totally worth it.\n\nOne of the highlights for me was the shooting range. You can try out some of the actual types of guns used during the war. I got to fire one, and it was both thrilling and surreal—like stepping straight into history.\n\nIf you're visiting Vietnam and want a deeper understanding of its history, this place is a must-see. Just wear comfy clothes and prepare for a unique, hands-on adventure!"

Located in Ninh Binh, it offers stunning limestone karsts, lush rice fields, and peaceful waterways that make you feel like you’ve stepped into a postcard.\n\nThe highlight of Tam Coc is the boat ride along the Ngo Dong River. A friendly local rows the boat—sometimes with their feet!—as you float through three magical caves surrounded by towering cliffs and endless greenery. The scenery is so peaceful and beautiful that you won’t want the ride to end.\n\nApart from the boat tour, Tam Coc has so much to offer. You can explore the ancient Bich Dong Pagoda, which is built into a mountain, or rent a bicycle and ride through the golden rice fields. The local food is also amazing, with fresh goat meat and crispy rice being must-tries.\n\nTam Coc is perfect for nature lovers, photographers, and anyone looking to escape the busy city life. Whether you're exploring caves, riding bikes, or just enjoying the peaceful views, this place will leave you in awe. It’s truly a hidden gem of Vietnam!"

It’s quite serene and unique - going with the row boat through the river, through a cave and then into an open space, surrounded by mountains.\n\nThe ladies rowing the boat are farmers I am told and after their work, they do this as an additional hustle. They row with their feet which is a sight to see, they’re quite experienced.\n\nBe warned! And be ready for them to hard sell you trinkets and souvenirs when they reach the end of the river (before turning back). We didn’t bring any money but we felt almost hijacked when she wouldn’t move the boat until she was truly convinced we couldn’t buy anything. The other boats did the same thing, stopped the boat for about 10 minutes until someone bought something (or couldn’t).\n\nIt detracted from the overall good experience from the row boat ride. We tipped her generously at the end when we were done and back in land where the money was available but we shouldn’t have been held “hostage” for quite a bit of time with the rower giving us a disapproving and unhappy, sour look because we couldn’t buy her trinkets."

We only had one vendor asking us to buy anything. (Photo) We went midweek and later at 4:30. So maybe that’s why. We don’t tip because 1) generally Vietnamese tourists don’t tip (be like the locals) and 2) it’s a terrible practice that allows businesses to profit by paying workers less."

Our tour guide made us paddle for the full 3 hours as she was barely paddling. Would have took us 5 hours without us. Paid 250 000 dong. If you want something worth the money I would highly suggest the bird sanctuary in Tam COC. Only cost 150 000 dong. Give yourself alot of time as there is SO much to see, super worth the money and your time. There is 4 caves and all the boat tours are included in your ticket. Make sure your there around 4PM and you'll see all the birds returning to the bird garden. Such a beautiful sight! Happy travels!"

Very professional. Although they were way too many people and I felt that kinda led to the long 2-3 hours timeline and not really the activities. Also limited flexibility. Also it was quite difficult to communicate with the man rowing as he didn’t understand any English.\n\nOutside of that, a good activity to appreciate the natural wonder and tick off your bucket list. Best to do early in the morning or later in the evening."

Don't use the driving directions, you'll end up on the highway.\nWe arrived around 3:45 and were one of the last tours out. We opted for #2 and weren't disappointed. It was a bit shorter but the temples and caves didn't disappoint. If you want your own boat for two people you have to buy four tickets, we  opted for 2 tickets and had two great boat mates from Canada and Thailand. We had a great time, no one trying to sell us anything, no scams, no hussles, no line ups and were one of the last boats of the river so it was very peaceful. Highly recommend. And if you don't mind biking in the dark, go late in the day. They close/stop selling tickets at 4pm"

          "reviewText": "Very interesting place to visit, unique history, set in a remote location, surrounded by beautiful vistas.\nTo get to any of the 15 pagodas in this area you must travel by boat. The Huong Pagoda was 3km upriver and you must visit the local temple as part of the journey. It's a very tranquil way to start.\nThe Pagoda itself is set up a short but steep walk up from the shore, and is maintained by a group of working monks. Unique to this Pagoda, is that is a monk dies here, they are given their own tomb on the grounds, and they're cast as a statue, and after 200 years the statue will be painted gold, as it is believed they have achieved enlightenment as a Buddha.\nThe star attraction is the cave at the top of the nearby mountain, said to be the restimg place of a king's daughter. You can walk to the summit (3,400 steps) but unless you are very, very fit you'll want to take the cable car. There is still another 200 or so steps to the summit, before you decend into a very stunning and tranquil cave.\nOverall I'd say it's well worth the visit, however there are a few things to be aware of:\n1) There is a festival here Jan-Mar, that attracts 2mil worshippers. The river is choked with boats, and it is shoulder to shoulder walking room. This in itself would be an experience.\n2) The place is step up to sell to those visitors during the festival - everywhere the path is lined with makeshift shops and restaurants all the way to the summit. Outside of the festival time period the majority of these are closed, so you are walking past walls of tarps.\n3) The heat - there is nowhere to hide from it. Especially on high humidity days. There are no air-conditioned buildings, just fans and refrigerated drinks. A number of our group suffered heat exhaustion, and there was little relief until we were back on the bus."

It has to be the best experience I’ve had in Laos so far .. the drive up to the cave is spectacular; the boatman is excellent and certainly looks after you on your journey; the experience is something you’ll never forget and it is so cheap to do. It was 200,000 Kip per person, if you’re on your own it’s a little more, but still excellent value for money. You need shoes that you don’t mind getting wet, and if you fancy a swim at some point there are places before the cave so you might want your swimming costume and a towel. From when you park to when you finish your tour it is a good two and half hours. We went end of April and we had to get out once for the boat to be pushed as it’s low water .. but that’s part of the adventure! We also stopped once going up and could walk around the stunning cave for about 10/15 minutes before continuing onward to the village where we sat chatting with locals and enjoyed a drink. It was then back to the boat and on our return we had another stop off inside with a photo opportunity.. so magical."

Location: BUT we wish we would’ve known that the lodges are on a tourist attraction park…\nWe arrived around 4 am and when we woke up we were pretty surprised to see tourists walking on our doorstep. We wish it was more clear that the lodges are in the Hang Mua park so take this in consideration when you book the lodge.\nThe pool was closed while we were there but we did got a discount for that. The staff and service was overall good. Except for the laundry, it was quick, but it wasn’t clean and also my pants shrunk a bit.\nWhen we checked out they forgot to charge us for the laundry and the scooters we rented. They texted and called us several times while we were already on our way to Hanoi. We paid the remaining via our next hotel which they contacted to transfer it.\nBoth these experiences made me write the review but we enjoyed the room."

However, the view at the top was worth it. It was one of the breathtaking view with majestic mountainous scenery."

So many different viewpoints and sections of the fall to see. And getting to these areas was easy, just a relatively short walk along well maintained paths.\n\nIf you keep going, you eventually get to a really neat beach. You aren't permitted to swim there, but it is a super relaxing and beautiful place to unwind for a few minutes before walking up the hill.\n\nThere is an entrance fee to get in, which I think was around 30,000 kip. In my opinion, it was absolutely money well spent."

A light breakfast, a bottle of water, a life jacket, a lift to the start point where kayaks were awaiting for us. Small group (7), a talkative guide, and a peaceful adventure down the Mekong with a swim, dolphins, small islands, sand. Five stars from the family, including our teens. Thanks !"

You do need to be confident in the water to take part but the boats are super stable so you shouldn't need to swim - unless you want to. We stopped for a swim in the shallower parts of the river and it was a great oportunity to re-fuel with a snack that our guides provided. The actual journey was great, you mainly navigate down stream but when you are around the dolphins you might have to paddle against the current. We took the afternon trip and ended up watching dolphins as the sun set.  All in all the experience was amazing and our guides were really professional but approachable."

He knew the river and gave us good safety instructions and we all had a safe fun journey down the mighty Mekong River. We saw huge trees, lots of golden sand, had a swim, ate sticky rice cooked in bamboo, kayaked through forested sections, past an island and to the dolphin colony. Lots of tourists go out in motorized boats which must be upsetting for the dolphin population.  We were respectful distances, and paddled to various vantage points , not making lots of noise. The sunset was magic, the other participants were great company, guide spoke excellent English and was generous with information.  I recommend this experience.  Good value for money."

Also the way is very steep and has not always a hand railing. After you reached the top, you get honoured with a great view over the Mekong River and the city of Pakse. It’s an amazing atmosphere up there.\nThe Phousalao Temple consists of several buildings, Temples and hundreds of small Buddhas.\nIf you cannot climb those stairs, take a car (not a motorcycle with sidecar) and drive up.\nIf you are in the region, it is a must to visit the Temple Phousalao."

          "reviewText": "Wat Phra That Phanom  is a Buddhist temple in the That Phanom District in the south of Nakhon Phanom Province, all within the Isan region of Thailand near the Lao border. According to local legend, the temple contains in the pagoda the Phra Uranghathat (พระอุรังคธาตุ)/Phra Ura (พระอุระ)/Buddha's breast bones. As such, it is one of the most important structures for Theravada Buddhists and the most important Buddhist site in the province, with an annual week-long festival being held in the town of That Phanom to honour the temple. These festival attract thousands of people who make pilgrimages to the shrine. In Thai folk Buddhism, Wat Phra That Phanom is a popular pilgrimage destination for those born in the year of the Monkey.\n\nThe That Phanom Chronicle documented that the Phra That Phanom stupa was first constructed 8 years after the Buddha's passing by the five kings of the Mon kingdom, known as Sri Gotupura. However, archaeological findings suggest that the earliest structure found dates back to the 7th or 8th century CE.\nAccording to local legend, the Buddha told Mahakasyapa, one of his principal disciples, that once he died, Mahakasyapa was to bring his breast bones to 'Phu Kampra to allow Buddhism to continue on. Then in 525 B.C, Mahakasyapa then decided on constructing a temple on Phu Kampra. Joined by 500 Arhats and 5 Phrayas, they built the Phra That Phanom stupa primarily from clay and once completed, the Buddha's breastbones were brought over from India and placed inside.\nThe pagoda is believed to have been built before the 1100s with its original Khmer design. However years of being part Lao kingdoms led to several renovations which created the current pagoda in a Lao style. In 1690, the pagoda was restored and raised to about 47 meters, and then by a further 10 meters in 1940.\nIn 1935, the complex was registered as an ancient monument for preservation by the Fine Arts Department of Thailand.\nIn March 1975, an earthquake caused cracks to appear. On 11 August 1975 at 7:38 p.m, the entire pagoda collapsed due to several days of heavy rain. it was rebuilt with funds raised by public subscription and from the Royal Thai Government, which was completed on 23 March 1979. Then current king Bhumibol and Queen Sirikit along with other royal members visited the site when the Buddha's relics were re-installed. Many valuables were placed inside during its rebuilding and a 110 kilogram gold sphere was added on top the pagoda. Buddhists from Laos also participated, placing many valuable items from Vientiane within, such as Lan Xang style golden seven-tiered umbrella. To help protect the temple, around 4 hectares around the front part were included into the register to further help preserve the site. This is called the 'Buddha Area'"

We cycled to the far end which was fairly challenging, took about 1:45 with some short stops, taking it easy on the downhill stretches as the ground was wet) - the road is overall uphill on the way into the park. Enjoyed a rest for coffee at the park centre, then hiked the loop at the end (took 2:20 including time exploring the cave). Almost had the hike to ourselves. Lunch back at the park centre was fresh, cheap and enjoyable. Cycled back (very grateful for the downhill gradient, apart from a few steep uphill sections) and explored prehistoric cave on the way. Long and tiring day but very worthwhile. The road was mostly free from any traffic - only a few cars and motorbikes passed us all day - and the road surface was good."

I came up from Ninh Binh and can only recommend doing so if you are in the area it is a quite relaxing drive with the scooter without any traffic.\n\nMake sure to visit the prehistoric human caves and the ancient tree. The tree might not sound too spectacular, but it was probably my favorite thing to do! You have to take a small path into the jungle and you can continue on this path deeper into the jungle if you want (a guide i met on the way told me it goes on for 10km). It is really amazing to experince the jungle this way and no worries, you cannot get lost, the path is quite easy to follow.\n\nAt the end of the road through the park you can find a restaurant for lunch.\n\nThere is also a monkey reservatory but i was too late to visit (it is only open from 13:30 to 16:30).\n\nI highly recommend visitinf this park if you are in the Ninh Binh area!"

The road was very quiet and there are a lot of hikes to do there. I’m nice you are comfortable with the road you can get some speed at times which if you are adrenaline junky like myself but you can also take your time. I would recommend getting a group of people interested in going and just get yourself there. You can also go to see some monkeys at the sanctuary and make a day of it. 10/10 would recommend"

Communication with the park via email was a bit tricky but in the end everything worked out. I was accompanied by my guide, ranger L (but I don't know if it is written correctly), and a porter, Lang. L was very knowledgeable about the primates (we started the tour with a visit at the primates rescue center) and the species present in the park. The hike through the forest was very cool, we even saw the king Cobra! We hiked for 4 hours until we reached a small stream where we set up the camp. There were really a lot of leeches, so be prepared for that. Lang was born in the primary forest and he was very skilled about life in the forest. For instance, he collected bamboo rots and cooked them inside the bamboo on the fire. We ate dinner and then we went for 1h of night spotting but we didn't see much other than a few spiders. The morning after the hike lasted only 1h, until we reached the main road, where our car was already waiting for us. I would have liked the second day to be a bit longer. The price is a bit high if you go alone, but it was definitely the wildest experience I had so far!"

You definitely need a bike or car when inside the park as it's too vast to see things otherwise, but I believe you can rent there. We stayed overnight in a nice room/hut with ensuite for 500k although there were cheaper options they looked too cold! It was nice to do some jungle walks and see massive old trees although the conservation areas were closed over lunch when we planned to go so we didn't get to see them. Nice place and you don't need more than a day to see most of what it has to offer (in January, apparently other months offer night walks when more animals are about). 60k entry. Bring a headlamp to see the caves! Food was not great but at least cheap considering it's the only option."

          "reviewText": "Great trekking experience for amateurs, combining mountain trek, caves exploration and swimming.\n\nWhilst Son Doong tour is more extreme and requires good investment (strength, time & money), Tu Lan tours are much more reasonable for majority enthusiasts.\n\nTu Lan caves have both dry and wet caves, so you can balance between climbing, swimming and trekking.\n\nThere’re many tours ranging from 1-4 days with these caves, operated by Oxalis. We chose the 3D2N tour, cost VND 8M.\n\nOxalis team could be ranked 5* with all their considerate services. Schedule is clear & managed well, guide & life guards have good experience and food are more than enough :)\nWe felt quite safe, enjoyable and of course, the scenery is fabulous.\n\nIf you want to have some me-time in the middle of the jungle, sleep in tent and no hassle of phone, mails or chaos.. book a tour and enjoy!!!"

( It's worth the effort of waking up early, taking breakfast at 6am, leaving hotel at 630am to attend 730am Holy Mass at this majestic cathedral!)\nIt has Great history place for Catholic tradidions, French Church in the North of Vietnam. If you go to Ninh Binh, must visit for Christian especially Catholics!\nPhat Diem Cathedral  consisted of one big central church and 4 smaller ones surrounding this main architecture. The churches were beautifully blended of the traditional Vietnamese culture and architecture and the Western religion reflecting in every single corner. The stand out is a pagoda style roof. The interior is very brightly decorated.\nThe interior has a well recognizable Romanesque-like arrangement with its central nave and side aisles separated by wooden columns, terminating in the raised sanctuary. While the interior particulars may be distinctly oriental or Vietnamese in most regards, the basic architectural structure are thoroughly rooted in the Roman basilica.\nYou will feel the youthfulness, vibrant atmosphere of Mass when compared to attending Mass at the western hemisphere churches where there are no young people willing to spend their Sunday morning at church anymore. Here 75% of the Mass attendance are young people,  kids and children!\nWe also met very nice people who greeted us with warmth."

There, you can take a tour around the island by walking, biking, riding a motorcycle or a motorcycle cart. The guesthouse is as cheap as 25 cents per night and you can enjoy the sandy beach as much as you’d like. During festival seasons, it will be more crowded as people of the city gather to watch festive boats, fireworks or have a dance party at the beach. My favorite thing about this island is the Pomelo fruit native to the land on the island. From my experience, it is THE BEST pomelo I’ve had and will ever have. Sweet, juicy, delicious!

I would suggest allocate 3-4 hours for this magnificent place, a lot of people miss this great spot as it’s a little out of the way, but if you are travelling by private car / taxi, this is worth the Ten Dollars USD cost I must say. This gave me a totally different look, feel and experience comparing to the Angkor Wat"

It is really interesting what you learn via travel as this was the capital of the Chenla Kingdom, which ruled over much of what is now Cambodia and Laos from the 6th to the 9th centuries. You would not know that but it explains the abundance of temples in the area including Prasat Sambor, which is the largest and most well-preserved temple in the complex. And there are lots of things to see if you get on motor bikes to head out there."

Of course, I'm biased, but let me explain that this was one of the last things I did in Thailand before going back to Bangkok. Meaning, before I went here I was in Phuket, Krabi, Koh Phi Phi, Phang Nga, Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai.\n\nLet me get to the experience for you. We arrived via car, and immediately went to go get lunch at the only restaurant in the area. After lunch, we were joined by another family and rented a truck to go the ~1km down the cliff, and to the start of the hiking area.\n\nThe hike was guided, and the guide would explain to you the different pools and holes. S/he would take you to specific holes and tell you what they looked like. A heart, Mickey Mouse head and 800 shaped hole are to name a few.\n\nIf you choose to do so, you could also hire a boat to go on a river cruise through the canyon area.\n\nThat being said, perhaps my grading of 3 stars is a bit harsh in comparison to others that have been here, but I feel it realistic in the sense that if you were to ask, \"Hey, I'm going to Thailand, should Ubon be high on my list?\"\n\nMy response would be: \"Only if you have enough time, like exploring and it is not your first trip to Thailand.\"\n\nI do not feel that this is a place that you should really go out of your way for. But is it worth experiencing? Yes, that is the short answer.\n\nDecide for yourself whether you like it or not. I would never say don't do something, if you asked if you should try it. The better question would be \"Do you think I will like it?\"\n\nMy answer to that is, the novelty of the place will wear away quickly."

I'd definitely visit again.\nThe waterfall is gushing so much and it's even more intriguing that it's the most powerful one in the world when it comes to water flow. In fact, it's more than all of the other top 10 combined. Mind blowing!\nThe toilets come with a small charge but it's fine. They're not the most clean but they're not horrific as well, especially for public toilet standards in Laos. The walk can be a lot in the heat (even though it's not far from the entrance) so please be hydrated."

It is one of the worth visiting places for visitors while exploring Don Khone Island, which is non-touristy and smaller compared to other waterfalls in the region.\n\nThe falls are about a 25-minute moto-bike ride from the Don Det-Don Khone Bridge. After riding on a bumpy dirt road that winds through the middle of the island, small signs direct visitors toward a suspension bridge. The bridge is safe, but likely to bring fears of those who care for dangling over rocks and a rushing river. Leaving moto-bikes behind, the falls are just about a 5-minute walk from the bridge.\n\nThe walk to the waterfalls is adventurous and involves a traipse over a sizeable wooden suspension bridge above the roaring rapids of the falls. From this bridge, visitors can witness the panoramic views of the falls and beautiful countryside consisting of green rice fields. A walk further along the trail takes visitors to other points of the waterfalls. There is also another smaller bridge, which leads to walls built by the French for logging during the colonization times\n\nDuring the rainy season, it may be difficult for tourists to see much of the falls, and be prepared to get wet LoL"

          "reviewText": "Phra That Choeng Chum is a major and sacred religious monument on the eastern side of Sakhon Nakhon in the grounds of Phra That Choeng Chum temple. The structure is rectangular and made with mortar and bricks reaching a height of 24 meters. If you look carefully at a ten-satang coin, you will see it featured on the reverse side.\n\nSakhon Nakhon was a major city in the Khmer Empire of Khotraboon, and  its glory days were between the 12th and 16th centuries. Today the city of Sakhon Nakhon does not hold much for the tourist but Wat Phra That Choeng Chum Worrawiharn is well worth inspection.\n\nClose to the vast Nong Han Lake in Sakhon Nakhon, Wat Phra That Choeng Chum was originally a 10th century Khmer monastery. Today the temple is highly revered as it is believed that the four incarnations of the Buddha came to this location and pressed their footprint in the soil here. The chedi was built to cover the footprints of the four Buddha's.\nThe temple derives its name from the Phra That Choeng Chum Chedi and is an important pilgrimage site for Thai Buddhists plus a magnet for the local population. In addition to the Chedi are several other attractive buildings, including a wooden temple that is under construction at the time of writing (27 March 2016) which sits inside an octagonal pond.\n\nThere are the standard Naga snakes, temple guardians in the form of Chinese style lions, gold leaf decoration everywhere and a couple of attractive floral arrangements that utilise some traditional Thai carts. The majority of what is on view is inside a reasonably large compound which is kept very neat and tidy, but there is more to see outside the main compound where there is a car park and market.\n\nWhen we arrived, we were treated to a traditional Thai dance by 75 ladies, presumably from Sakhon Nakhon. It looked as though it was a rehearsal for a later festival as they were dressed very casually. Once they had finished their dance they were incredibly friendly and inquisitive about this ferang that was wondering around the compound which I found a little surprising but pleasing at the same time. Seeing a ferang is especially rare in this part of Issan as a number of ex-pats have settled down here with their Thai lady.​\n\nBecause the temple grounds are particularly impressive it can be quite easy to forget that there are further sights inside some of the buildings. While there is nothing exceptional about the interiors they are worth a look.​"

From the moment we set foot in Cát Tiên National Park, we were immersed in the breathtaking beauty of nature, guided by the expertise and enthusiasm of our tour leader, Mr Dzung.\n\nDuring our time in the park, we had the rare opportunity to observe wildlife at night—a magical experience that allowed us to witness animals in their natural habitat under the cover of darkness. The daytime expedition to Bàu Sấu (Crocodile Lake) was equally mesmerizing, offering stunning landscapes and fascinating insights into the park's diverse ecosystem.\n\nWhat made this trip even more special was the dedication and deep knowledge of our guide, Nguyễn Lương Dũng. His passion for nature and his ability to share engaging stories about the flora and fauna of Cat tien truly enriched our experience. He ensured that every moment was both educational and exciting, making this journey an unforgettable experience for our family.\n\nWe highly recommend VietNature Tour to anyone looking for an authentic and immersive adventure in Vietnam’s wilderness. If you’re fortunate enough to have Mr Dzung as your guide, you’re in for an exceptional experience!"

We had extra bad luck due to 2 weddings going on at the same moment with equally irritating and loud music. Our room was not prepared as he seemed to have forgotten our booking. so double check with him if you do book. After staying in the room for an hour or so we decided to leave as we anticipated a night without sleeping. Rico, the owner, demanded full pay for the night. This did not seem reasonable. We offered to pay half and finally paid what he asked for as he became pretty agressive. Will never go again and will only recommend to die hard motor drivers (this does seem to be Rico's passion) who bring good quality earplugs and/or are used to lots of traffice noise. :-)"
