Quiet -it is a residential area so I was surprised the place was still pretty quiet and relaxed,\n2. Location and view - wonderful view of the river, taxis easy to get, and can walk (if you dare cross the highway on foot!!!! - that was an experience in itself)\n3. Nice restaurant within the compound\n4. Complete amenities for the easy traveller - laundry, food, minishop, tennis/basketball court/gym, coffee shop, tennis instructors, swimming pool\n5. Rooms were decent and fairly large (I was alone but I can imagine the my suite able to take 4 people quite easily)\n6. Internet everywhere.\n7.  Price is quite reasonable.\n8. Not quite HCMC center but taxis are quite affordable.\n9 . Staff quite helpful (and very polite)\n\nOverall, pretty happy with my stay. And I will surely try to come back if I want some R&R."

However the same cannot be said for the smaller bedroom. It is much smaller and you cannot close and lock the door. Also there are small holes for decoration in the wall which faces the living room so there is no privacy.\nKeep that in mind before taking the smaller bedroom\nThe breakfast is ordinary and the service is slow. I don't like the system where you have to order the food and then it comes to you. A simple buffet where all the options are available  is much better and simpler.

Generally, the front office & restaurant staffs are very polite, good & ready to serve. Johnny specifically helped to change my room after the first night to a brighter & cleaner room. He is attentive & can recognise me when I stepped into the hotel as this is the 3rd time staying in this same hotel.

The hotel is getting old and needs a refurbished work. The hot water takes 2 mins in the taps.\nMost of the team members can connect in English.\nThe staff are helpful too .\nThere is no swimming pool , bar or dedicated support staff for luggage or misc  .\nThe stairs are high ...10 stairs .so could be difficult with big suitcases.\nThe breakfast  buffet was dull , but the main attendant was prompt to get a option for us .\nSo vegetarian people do ask and get the extra care.\nOverall it's a average."

We had a washing machine and had rails to hang washing out on balcony to dry. It really was a \"home from home\". The pool area was very clean and well looked after with plenty sun loungers. We made use of the gym which was well equipped. The staff were polite and friendly and really happy to help with any requests we had. We had an amazing month and would love to return again sometime."

The hotel and property itself was nicely maintained and all staff were wonderful and friendly. We stayed in the 3 bedroom suite and appreciated having a washer and dryer and the complimentary water and instant ramen! The front desk and reception staff is truly so accommodating and made our stay comfortable. There is a convenience store onsite that's convenient. The hotel hosted an Easter egg hunt when we were visiting - my son enjoyed and and it was such a nice touch!"

It had two bathrooms and was equipped for long-term use, with oven, hob, washing machine and full-size fridge-freezer. All the appliances were very good quality. Although the pool had a shallow end, you could still swim laps. For me, location isn't such a critical factor as it is in, say, Bangkok since it is very easy to move around the city with Grab. You never have to wait more than two minutes for a ride anywhere. We only ate at the restaurant once and, as mentioned by many reviewers, found it to be substandard. Given the number of options in the vicinity I would not consider that a deal breaker. I would thoroughly recommend these serviced apartments."

Please note that on the night of the bad experience we had there was a party, sponsored by the hotel.  We could not attend as there was no table for us and they claimed to be full.\n\nWe went to the hotel restaurant and ordered 4 different dishes.  Total time before first plate arrived was 1 hour 20 minutes.  My wife, speaking fluent Vietnamese asked them to prepare the food with no spice or anything spicy.  I took one bite of the food and had to stop eating any more.  It was too spicy and one bite started making my stomach sick.  The additional dishes were bought out at 1 hour 30 minutes and the last dish was never brought out.\n\nWhen I brought my concerns to the wait staff, we had to argue to remove the food we never received and still had to pay for the spicy dish.\n\nIt‚Äôs not the money, it‚Äôs the principle of it all.  If they could not serve us because of the event, they should have told us to begin with.  Then, not taking ownership of their bad service made matters worse.\n\nAll the hotel can offer is good will and they let us down.  No reason to patronize them, so we cancelled the remainder of our trip with them and found a larger apartment at less cost in D4."

They were all welcoming and cheerful despite working hard through out the day.\n\nMr. Hieu, from day 1, treated us with the best service. He even gave his personal number to me so that I can contact him if I have any issues. Never once in my stays, even in 5 star hotels, have the staff reached out to me and connected with clients to this extent.\n\nWith respect to rooms, they were reasonable for the price. Cleanliness wise, I am pretty impressed with the lady cleaner on how my room is always in top condition everytime I return back after my breakfast. The beds were so comfortable and they are generous with the pillows in the room as well. The best part of security of the room will be the buzzer noise that indicates that you haven't closed the room door properly.\n\nOverall, I had a fantastic stay at this hotel and no doubt I will be returning to stay here again given the professionalism of the staff. It still warms my heart on how the staff made me feel like the hotel was my second home and a safe place.\n\nSide note: When I return next time, I will definately want to bring the entire team who assisted me for dinner\n\nKeep up the good work guys and see you again‚ò∫Ô∏è"

The shower is very low so if you're tall then you'll just need to hold the handle. Very small bathroom but it is clean. You can find cheaper and better accommodation if you look."

For the price of 1.7 million/night, the breakfast was below par. Cafe was very small which made dining not comfortable."

I cannot say enough for the house cleaning department.  Binh Nguyen who cleaned my room and was very polite and greeted me with a warm welcome .

On the positive side, the apartment is spacious and well-furnished, making it a comfortable stay for us. The housekeeping service was also good and attentive.\n\nHowever, I an disappointed with a few aspects. Despite the high rent, the hotel does not provide basic amenities like water, detergents , dish ckeaner, and washroom accessories. Instead, they expect you to buy these essentials from outside, which I found unreasonable.\n\nAdditionally, the hotel has a very strict visitor policy, which was inconvenient for us. The apartments, although spacious, felt more like hotel rooms.\n\nOverall, while residence has its positives, the drawbacks left a sour taste. If they could revisit their policies and provide basic amenities, I would consider staying here again."

Lovely pool for the hot afternoons. Gym, games rooms, even a guest cinema room ! The staff are incredibly helpful. Breakfast is very good. We also had a few lunches which were great as well. Very central location near to the War Remnants museum, Independence Palace, cathedral etc. Perfect for families. My teenager & friend on their gap years joined us here for a few days and were delighted to find the apartment had a washing machine and tumble drier. Very good value for money. A bit of noise from the ubiquitous karaoke bars but you are in a big city, and our apartment had double-double glazing which helped."

A bedroom in a round glass room in the lounge room, and shower over the toilet.\nVery minimal interaction with any staff. So can't say anything on that.\nNeed security to give you access to the roof top pool. So you have to come down to reception, then go up again. Pool doesnt look all that used. The rooftop bar was closed and looks like it has been for a long time.\nAnd these 2 items were the reason for booking this place.\nI'd probably look at another place if you want to have a drink by the pool while kids have a swim."

Now the owner acuses me saying that I refused the room that she offered, that is simply not true. I was not offered a room. After traveling for 26 hours I would have accepted any place where I could sleep. I spoke to 3 more people while I was there, and they had the same problem. I would stay away from this place."

Not very English friendly. 2/3 of our washroom lights were burnt out and when I went to ask they said to ask the next day, which should have been  caught when they cleaned the room (so did they even clean it or did they just make up the beds?)\n\nConclusion: we only took the room for a place to sleep for 2 nights for a decent price.

Also the staff who brings up our grabfood orders every time, thank you.\n\nThe room layout is great and kept very clean. Because of the national day rehearsals we got to watch the fireworks from our room. Hotel is well located too, walking distance to many things and convenience stores right beside and opposite. 10/10."

They were very kind, attentive, helpful, often beyond simple good business practice.\nThe staff was also interacting with me via whatsapp to help in any way they could.\nThe location is great for visiting the city center (I was here on business, so I didn't do much of this) and is directly across from the Little Tokyo enclave, which has countless japanese restaurants (and bars, if you're into that kind of thing), and walking distance from most city attractions and museums.\nMy room (a studio) was modern, large, well maintained (aging a bit, but still in perfect condition) and the room staff was discreet and efficient. Comfortable bed and linen, quiet. Good shower.\nBreakfast is a changing buffet, with stations where they'll make you vietnamese soups etc. Mix of western and eastern food.\nThere is a pool in open air on the 10th floor, which I did not use, but it seemed lovely.\nAlso on the 10th floor you have access to a free laundry, which I used a lot (you'll likely sweat a lot in VN.)\nI spent most of my time in district 2 while not working, and using Grab to drive me around was super easy, and quite cheaper than a taxi.\nOverall, the Signature M Village Le Thanh Ton deserves my 5 stars."

The staff was enthusiastic, the check-in procedure was smooth - this is very important when the work schedule is tight. The room was clean, modern, fully equipped with a desk, high-speed wifi - very suitable for business needs. The light was good, ensuring a good night's sleep after a stressful day at work. A big plus is the central location in District 1, near office buildings and the airport, making travel much more convenient. In addition, the hotel also supports setting up a pick-up car, which is very convenient."

The staff was really friendly and welcoming. The breakfast buffet was amazing. Easily my favorite hotel in S√†i G√≤n and an easy recommendation for anyone visiting the city and wanting to stay in District 1.\n\nEdited:\nAfter a couple more weeks of reflecting on my stay, Signature by M Village L√™ Th√°nh T√¥n has become my favorite hotel not just in Saigon, but in Vietnam. It's that good. Hopefully, it stays that way until the next time I am able to return."
